# The 101 Deck Standard

What a foundational course deck has to contain before it counts as finished.
Companion to `flagship-course-standard.md`, which governs the twenty flagship
courses and does not apply here: decks have no modules, so they carry no
excerpts, worked examples or reflection prompts.

Enforced by `scripts/check-decks.py` (CI job `decks`).

## Why this file exists

The flagship standard was written down, and the flagships drifted anyway until
someone measured them. The decks had the opposite problem: **nothing was written
down at all**, so nobody could tell a thin deck from a dense one without opening
it, and no drift was ever reported because there was no bar to drift from.

Measured 2026-08-22 across all 52 decks. The result is not a gradient:

| | decks | words/slide | words |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thin | **41** | 67–81 | 6,691–8,057 |
| *(nothing in between)* | 0 | 82–139 |: |
| Dense | **11** | 140–227 | 14,426–23,585 |

Every deck has ~100 slides and ~102 SVG figures, so the shell is uniform and
the *content* varies **3.4×**. `sel-basics` gives a reader 67 words a slide;
`inequality-basics` gives 227. Both present as a hundred-slide course.

The table above was measured on 2026-08-22 by splitting raw markup, where every `&mdash;` counted as a word. Re-measured on real words after the em dashes came out of the copy, the dense group runs 136 to 227 and the floor is 130, still inside the gap.

The cliff between 81 and 140 is two generations of deck, not a spectrum. That
is what makes a floor defensible: it is not an aesthetic preference, it is the
line the newer decks already clear and the older ones do not approach.

## The bar

### 1. Density: **≥130 words per slide**

Roughly 14,000 words across a 100-slide deck. This is the floor the twelve
dense decks already meet, not an aspiration.

A deck below it is not "concise". At 67 words a slide a concept gets a heading,
a sentence and a diagram, which is enough to name an idea and not enough to
teach it: the "over the surface" failure. Density is a proxy for whether the
deck explains *why*, not only *what*.

### 2. Structure: density has to come from teaching, not padding

The dense decks differ from the thin ones structurally, not just in word count:

| | `mel-basics` (220 w/slide) | `sel-basics` (67 w/slide) |
|---|---|---|
| Tables | **33** (floor of the dense group: 7) | 1 |
| Two-column layouts | **76** (floor: 28) | 8 |
| List items | 223 | 89 |
| Stat elements | 75 | 38 |

So the requirement is not "write more words". It is: with each threshold set
at the **floor of the dense group, not its ceiling**, because `mel-basics`
carries 33 tables and 76 two-column slides and setting the bar there fails four
decks that are demonstrably fine:

- **≥7 tables**: comparisons, frameworks side by side, before/after. A table
  forces a claim to be specific in a way a paragraph lets you avoid.
- **≥28 two-column slides**: the format that carries "here is the idea, here
  is what it looks like in practice".
- **≥1 SVG figure per slide** (all decks already meet this).

### 3. Sources

Every statistic carries its source inline: survey, year, publisher. A number
without provenance is decoration, and in a teaching deck it is worse than
omitting the number.

### 4. Register

The same rule as everywhere else on the platform: no epigrams, no
"in today's rapidly evolving landscape", no sentence that could open any deck
on any subject. If a paragraph would survive being moved into a different
course unchanged, it is not teaching that course.

## The backlog is part of the standard

The backlog is now empty: as of 2026-08-23 all 52 decks clear the floor. It
started at 41 decks, each listed in `DECK_BACKLOG` in `scripts/check-decks.py`
with its measured density; the guard printed the list and its size on every run
until the last entry cleared.

`DECK_BACKLOG` is deliberately kept in place rather than deleted. Its two
properties are what make the floor enforceable at all, and an empty dict is the
correct state for them to be in: a future deck that is genuinely mid-rewrite
can be listed and then must come off again.

Two properties keep the list from becoming a blindfold, matching the `EXEMPT`
convention in the other guards:

- A deck **not** on the list that falls below the floor **fails**. New thin
  decks cannot be added.
- A deck **on** the list that now clears the floor **also fails**, so it must
  be removed. The backlog can only shrink.
