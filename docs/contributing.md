# Contributing to ImpactMojo

Thank you for your interest in contributing! ImpactMojo is built by and for the development community. Whether you're a practitioner who spotted an outdated statistic, an educator with a great case study, or a developer who can fix a bug — there's a meaningful way for you to contribute.

## You Don't Need to Be Technical

Many of our most valuable contributions come from practitioners, not programmers. Here's how you can help without writing a single line of code:

| What you can do | How | Difficulty |
|-----------------|-----|------------|
| **Report an error** | Found a broken link, wrong statistic, or outdated reference? Open a [Content Issue](https://github.com/Varnasr/ImpactMojo/issues/new?template=content_issue.md) | Very easy |
| **Suggest a topic** | Know a topic that should be covered? Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/Varnasr/ImpactMojo/discussions/categories/ideas) | Very easy |
| **Share a case study** | Have a real-world development case study from your work? Email us at hello@impactmojo.in | Easy |
| **Translate content** | Help make courses available in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, or Marathi | Easy–Medium |
| **Review content** | Are you an expert in MEL, gender studies, or development economics? Help us review courses for accuracy | Easy |
| **Write a handout** | Create a reference sheet on a topic you know well | Medium |

## For Technical Contributors

If you're comfortable with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, there are plenty of ways to contribute:

| Area | Examples | Difficulty |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Bug fixes** | Broken links, layout issues, JavaScript errors | Easy–Medium |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation | Medium |
| **Design** | UI/UX improvements, mobile experience | Medium |
| **Tools & Labs** | Build or improve interactive learning tools | Hard |
| **Games** | New economics simulations | Medium–Hard |

### Getting Started (Technical)

ImpactMojo is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS project — no frameworks, no build step. You can run it locally with just a web browser and a simple server:

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ImpactMojo.git
cd ImpactMojo

# 2. Start a local server (pick whichever you have)
python -m http.server 8000
# or: npx http-server -p 8080

# 3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

# 4. Create a branch for your changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Make your changes, test locally

# 6. Commit using the prefix convention
git commit -m "Add: descriptive summary of what you did"

# 7. Push and open a Pull Request on GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Convention

Every commit message starts with a prefix that describes the type of change:

| Prefix | When to use it | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `Add:` | New feature, course, or tool | `Add: interactive budget planning lab` |
| `Fix:` | Bug fix or broken link | `Fix: broken nav dropdown on mobile Safari` |
| `Update:` | Improvement to existing content or code | `Update: MEL course module 3 with 2025 data` |
| `Translate:` | Translation work | `Translate: gender studies course to Hindi` |
| `Docs:` | Documentation changes | `Docs: add workshop facilitation guide` |
| `Refactor:` | Code restructuring (no behaviour change) | `Refactor: extract auth logic to separate file` |
| `Test:` | Adding or updating tests | `Test: add accessibility checks for games` |
| `CI:` | CI/CD pipeline changes | `CI: add broken link checker workflow` |
| `Chore:` | Maintenance (dependencies, configs) | `Chore: update dependabot config` |

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Test on desktop and mobile
- Include screenshots for visual changes
- Note if changes affect premium features

## Content Writing Style

If you're contributing educational content, here's what we aim for:

- **Tone:** Accessible but rigorous. Write for a practitioner with 2–3 years of experience.
- **Examples:** Prefer South Asian context (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka).
- **Jargon:** Define terms on first use. If it's a common sector term, add it to [ImpactLex](https://on-web.link/ImpactLex).
- **Attribution:** Always cite sources. Link to [DevDiscourses](https://www.impactmojo.in/dataverse) where possible.
- **Accessibility:** Use clear headings, alt text for images, and sufficient colour contrast.

## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Varnasr/ImpactMojo/issues) with the appropriate template:

- **Bug Report** — something is broken (link, layout, error)
- **Feature Request** — a new idea or improvement
- **Content Issue** — factual error, outdated information, missing topic
