# The Development Law Docket

Indian judgments that changed what development organisations, state programmes
and rights-holders can actually do.

Data: `data/judgments.json`. Guard: `scripts/check-judgments.py` (CI job
`judgments`). Guide sections: `scripts/build-law-guide-cases.py`.

## What this is, and what it is not

It is orientation. It is **not** legal advice, and it must never read as advice.
Holdings are summarised editorially; the linked judgment is authoritative.

That distinction is not a disclaimer to satisfy a lawyer. NGO staff will act on
what this page says, and the failure mode is specific: a case summary is exactly
the kind of text a language model produces fluently and wrongly, and a wrong
holding looks identical to a right one. Everything below exists to make that
failure visible instead of invisible.

## The two things that must be true of every entry

**It is sourced.** Every entry links to the judgment. `verified` records the
date, the source checked against, and the specific things checked: the case
name, the decision year, and named terms confirmed present in the judgment text.

**Its status is stated.** `status` is mandatory and constrained:

| status | means |
|---|---|
| `good-law` | stands, applied as decided |
| `codified` | Parliament enacted it; the statute now governs |
| `modified` | a later bench narrowed or reworked it |
| `partly-overruled` | part no longer holds |
| `overruled` | no longer good law |
| `under-reference` | pending before a larger bench |

There is deliberately **no `unknown`**. "Nobody checked" is not something this
file may say silently. Anything other than `good-law` must carry a
`status_note` explaining the qualification, and the guard enforces it.

This matters more than it sounds. Unni Krishnan was substantially reworked by
T.M.A. Pai. Section 66A was struck down in Shreya Singhal and is still used to
book people. Common Cause's living-will procedure was simplified in 2023
because the original was unworkable. An entry that omits this reads
authoritative and is worse than no entry.

## How the current set was built

Sixty candidate cases were resolved against Indian Kanoon, filtered on case
name and decision year, then re-checked: each entry declares terms that must
appear in the judgment text, and an entry whose terms are absent is dropped
rather than published.

Six were dropped on that check. Five were later found by searching for them
properly rather than re-running the same query, and are now in the docket; the
sixth, the right-to-food litigation, turned out to have been dropped on an
assertion of mine that was simply wrong (I required the phrase "Public
Distribution" in an order about ICDS). One drop is worth keeping in mind for
the opposite reason: a search for *Consumer Education & Research Centre v.
Union of India* matched **LIC v. CERC**, a different case, and the
name-and-year filter alone let it through. The term check is what caught it.

The lesson from the five is the one that generalises: **"my tool did not find
it" is not "it is not findable"**, and writing the former up as principled
restraint makes a research failure look like rigour.

### `meta.excluded` vs `meta.coverage_notes`

Two different claims, and mixing them shipped a bug (#1005).

`meta.excluded` means **absent**: a candidate considered and not published,
named so that a docket showing only what it found does not look more complete
than it is. The page renders it under *"What is deliberately not here"*.

`meta.coverage_notes` means **published, but read it narrowly**: a caveat about
what an entry that *is* here can be taken to stand for. The page renders it
under *"How these entries were checked"*, beside the Supreme-Court-only scope
line.

The right-to-food litigation sat in `excluded` while two of its orders were
live on the same page, because the note was written when the docket had neither
and nobody moved it when they went in. `scripts/check-judgments.py` now fails
when an `excluded` entry names a petition number the docket publishes: matched
on the citation number (`196 of 2001` ≡ `196/2001`) rather than party names,
since "Union of India" is one side of most of this file.

**What is verified is identity, not interpretation.** That a case exists, has
this name and this date, and contains these terms: checked. That the summary
correctly characterises what the case means: editorial. Do not describe this
dataset as verified case law.

## Adding an entry

1. Resolve the case and confirm name and year against the judgment text.
2. Write `holding` (what was decided) and `what_changed` (what a practitioner
   does differently). If you cannot write the second, the case may not belong.
3. Set `status`, and `status_note` if it is anything but `good-law`.
4. Tag `statutes` with the law-guide stem it belongs to, if any.
5. Run `python3 scripts/build-law-guide-cases.py`, then the guard.

## Coverage, stated plainly

Supreme Court of India only. High Court and tribunal decisions are not here,
and district and trial courts are absent from the underlying corpus entirely.
