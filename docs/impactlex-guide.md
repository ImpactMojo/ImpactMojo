# ImpactLex Guide

## What Is ImpactLex?

ImpactLex is ImpactMojo's **searchable glossary of development terms** — acronyms, concepts, formulas, frameworks, case studies, and institutions that development professionals encounter daily.

It lives at [impactmojo.in/impactlex](https://www.impactmojo.in/impactlex/), installs as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use, and draws on the same term pool as the 10 flagship ImpactMojo course lexicons — so what you learn in the MEL course shows up consistently wherever that term appears.

**Access:** Free — [Open ImpactLex](https://www.impactmojo.in/impactlex/)

## Using ImpactLex

### As a workshop reference

Project ImpactLex during sessions so participants can look up unfamiliar terms in real time. Development jargon is a real barrier — having a searchable reference reduces the "I don't want to ask what that means" problem.

### As a study aid

Ask participants to learn 5–10 new terms per week. The contextual definitions help them build vocabulary that connects to their actual work, not just to textbooks.

### Alongside courses

Each ImpactMojo flagship course has its own interactive lexicon. ImpactLex is the cross-cutting view — the same term pool, filtered by course when you want that, unified when you don't. If you're studying MEL, use the course lexicon or filter ImpactLex to `MEL`. If you're writing a proposal that spans MEL + Gender + Public Policy, use ImpactLex directly.

### For report writing

When participants are writing proposals or reports, ImpactLex helps them use terminology correctly. Misusing terms like "output" vs. "outcome" or "monitoring" vs. "evaluation" is common — ImpactLex provides clear definitions with practitioner context.

## Contributing

Find a missing term? Spot a definition that needs fixing? Click **Suggest a term** on any ImpactLex page. Submissions go to the moderation queue and appear once reviewed.

We especially welcome:
- South Asian schemes, institutions, and acronyms that don't exist elsewhere
- Practitioner-flagged cases where donor language differs from field reality
- Formulas with worked examples
- Contested terms — if "resilience" or "empowerment" means different things to different funders, we want to explain that

## Under the hood

ImpactLex is a static Progressive Web App hosted on Netlify with ImpactMojo. Data lives in InstantDB; a snapshot JSON file provides the offline fallback, so the app works even when InstantDB is unreachable. Content is drafted with AI assistance (Gemini/Grok/DeepSeek) and reviewed by a human editor before publishing.

## Tips

- **Install the PWA** for offline access — especially useful for field-based staff.
- **Deep-link specific terms** — every entry has a shareable URL, good for WhatsApp handoffs and workshop handouts.
- **Combine filters** — e.g., "category: method" + "course: MEL" to focus on evaluation methods only.
- **Can't find a term?** Submit it. The glossary grows from practitioner use, not desk research.
