## What Are the ImpactMojo Games?

ImpactMojo offers **interactive games** that teach development-relevant concepts through strategic decision-making and simulation. Each game takes 10–20 minutes to play and covers a specific concept — from game theory and market failures to climate action, gender equity, public health, and digital ethics.

These aren't quizzes or flashcards. They're interactive simulations where your decisions have consequences, and the concepts become clear through play rather than lecture.

All games are **free, browser-based, and require no login**. They are self-hosted at `/Games/` on impactmojo.in.

### MiroFish AI Agents

10 of the 12 games feature **MiroFish AI agents** — AI-powered opponents with distinct South Asian identities, backstories, and strategic personalities. Each agent has calibrated personality traits (cooperation bias, risk tolerance, memory weight) that shape their decisions.

The AI system uses a **multi-provider LLM fallback chain** (DeepSeek → Groq → Gemini → Together → OpenAI) via a Supabase Edge Function. When LLM providers are unavailable, a local personality engine generates decisions using weighted heuristics — so games always work, even offline.

See [Game Agents documentation](game-agents.md) for technical details on the AI system.

## The 12 Games

### Collective Action & Cooperation

| Game | Concept | What You Learn | AI Agents |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Public Good Game** | Free-rider problem | Why people under-contribute to shared resources, and what mechanisms sustain cooperation | Meera, Arjun, Fatima, Ravi |
| **Commons Crisis Game** | Tragedy of the commons | How communication, monitoring, and sanctions help communities manage shared resources like water, forests, or fisheries | Priya, Raj, Ananya, Karthik |
| **Cooperation Paradox** | Game theory | Why cooperation yields better outcomes but individual incentives push toward competition — Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficiency in action | Imran, Reshma |
| **Prisoners' Dilemma Game** | Strategic interdependence | How trust, reputation, and repeated interactions overcome cooperation failures | Sunita, Vikram, Lakshmi, Deepak |

### Markets & Decision-Making

| Game | Concept | What You Learn | AI Agents |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Opportunity Cost Game** | Tradeoffs | How every choice has a cost — the next-best alternative you gave up — and how this shapes policy decisions | Pallavi, Suresh |
| **Risk & Reward Explorer** | Behavioural economics | Risk preferences, expected utility, prospect theory — why people make seemingly irrational choices under uncertainty | Sanjay, Pooja, Arun |
| **Bidding Wars Game** | Auction theory | How different auction formats affect prices, why winners sometimes overpay (winner's curse), and how procurement works | Nandini, Sameer, Zara |
| **Information Asymmetry Game** | Asymmetric information | Adverse selection, moral hazard, and signalling — what happens when buyers and sellers know different things | Kavitha, Mohan, Aisha |

### Systems & Scale

| Game | Concept | What You Learn | AI Agents |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Network Effects Game** | Network economics | How value multiplies as more people join, critical mass dynamics, and why some platforms dominate | Tanvi, Harish, Divya |
| **Externality Game** | Market failures | Hidden social costs and benefits — pollution, education spillovers — and why markets alone don't solve them | Ashok, Nalini, Bina |
| **The Real Middle** | Inequality dynamics | Wealth distribution, income mobility, and the precarity of middle-class status in India | 5 simulated households |
| **Econ Concepts Puzzle** | Mixed economics | Economic reasoning through puzzles and brain-teasers covering supply/demand, game theory, and market structure | — |

### Beyond Economics

| Game | Concept | What You Learn | AI Agents |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Climate Action Challenge** | Climate science | Allocate resources between mitigation and adaptation across decades — the lesson that both are needed together | — |
| **Care Economy Challenge** | Gender equity | Experience the invisible burden of unpaid care work and how policy choices affect equity outcomes | — |
| **Epidemic Response** | Public health | Manage a disease outbreak across surveillance, treatment, prevention, community health workers, and communication | — |

## How Educators Can Use the Games

### As Workshop Openers

Play a game at the start of a session to introduce a concept experientially. Participants engage with the idea *before* you explain the theory — this creates curiosity and gives them a shared reference point for discussion.

**Example flow:**
1. Play the Public Good Game (10 minutes)
2. Debrief: "What happened? Why did contributions drop?" (10 minutes)
3. Introduce the formal concept of public goods and free-riding (15 minutes)
4. Discuss real-world applications in their programmes (15 minutes)

### As Classroom Activities

Games work well projected on a screen for group play. Have the class vote on decisions together, or split into teams and compare outcomes.

**Good pairings:**
- Public Good Game + Commons Crisis = comprehensive view of collective action
- Information Asymmetry + Externality = understanding market failures together
- Prisoners' Dilemma + Cooperation Paradox = deep dive into strategic thinking

### As Self-Study Assignments

Assign 2–3 games as pre-work before a workshop. Ask participants to write a one-paragraph reflection: "What surprised you? How does this concept show up in your work?"

### For Debrief Discussions

After any game, these questions work well:
- What strategy did you use? Did it change over rounds?
- What surprised you about the outcome?
- Where do you see this dynamic in your development work?
- What mechanisms could change the outcome?

## Getting Started

1. **Visit the Games section** on [impactmojo.in](https://www.impactmojo.in) — scroll to the Games showcase or find them in the catalog
2. **Start with Public Good Game or Prisoners' Dilemma** — these are the most intuitive entry points
3. **Play each game yourself first** before using it in a workshop, so you can anticipate participant questions
4. **No login or download required** — games run in any modern browser on desktop or mobile

## Tips

- **Games are designed for adults, not children.** The framing, language, and complexity are pitched at development practitioners and university students.
- **Debrief is where learning happens.** The game itself creates the experience; the discussion afterward creates the understanding. Always budget time for debrief.
- **Play multiple rounds.** Most games reveal deeper dynamics on second and third plays as participants adjust their strategies.
- **Connect to real programmes.** After playing the Commons Crisis Game, ask: "Where in your WASH programme do you see a commons dilemma?" This transfer step is essential.
