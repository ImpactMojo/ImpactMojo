## v10.290.0 — September 8, 2026 (A refused deploy trigger says so)

### Fixed

- **`verify-deploy.py` reported a refused build trigger as though it had worked** (#1074). The fallback exists for the case the script was written for: Netlify drops the merge webhook, production silently stays on the previous release. When that fallback POST was itself refused, the script printed `build triggered: None` — Netlify answers a refused POST with a JSON error body, so `b.get("id")` was `None` and the line read like a success with a missing field — then set `triggered = True` so it never tried again, and ended on the generic `no ready production deploy within Ns`. That closing line is also what a merely slow build produces, so the two situations were indistinguishable.

  On 2026-09-07 they had to be told apart. Netlify's API and its GitHub integration were down together from about 13:07 to 23:05 UTC: the v10.289.0 merge never built, the fallback returned 404 on every attempt, and none of that was legible in the output. The run was read as a defect in our own script and a bug was filed against it, wrongly. A build refused at the 90-second mark now says `TRIGGER REFUSED — HTTP 404: Not Found. Netlify has not been asked to build.` at the moment it happens, is retried up to three times instead of once, and is named with its status code in the closing line, which points at Netlify rather than at us.

  `curl_json` now returns the HTTP status alongside the body, which is what makes any of this possible, and parses leniently: Netlify does not always answer in JSON, and a `JSONDecodeError` inside a run whose whole job is to report that something failed would be its own small joke. The docstring also no longer claims the script checks that live `version.json` has advanced. It never did.

## v10.289.0 — September 7, 2026 (The results chain legend reads as sentences again)

### Fixed

- **The results chain legend rendered one word per line, at every width, from the day the page shipped** (#1072). Reported from a phone. `drawLegend()` wrote each row as a swatch `<span>`, a `<b>` for the label, and then the note as a **bare text node**, into `.rc-legend li { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 26px 1fr }`. That is three grid items, not two: CSS wraps a loose text node in an *anonymous grid item* and auto-places it like any other cell, so the note went to row 2, column 1, the 26px swatch track, widened only as far as its longest unbreakable word. Measured in Chromium, the four rows rendered **83×370**, **72×535**, **78×488** and **69×158**, identical at 390px, 768px and 1280px. The note is now wrapped in its own element, which puts exactly two children in the grid.

  **Nothing was going to catch it.** The markup is valid, every word is present and in the right order, contrast and tap targets are fine. axe passed 64 of 64 variants over that page and pa11y 23 of 23 pages, twice, because neither has an opinion about a paragraph laid out four words tall. `git log -L` puts both the CSS rule and the markup in the same commit as the page itself, and it survived two later passes over the same file, both spent looking at the diagram above the legend.

  So `tests/stray-grid-text.js` is new, in the `mobile` CI job. It renders every page under `fundamentals/` and `theories/` at 390px and 1280px and fails on any bare text node inside a grid or flex container that renders **under half its container's width and more than three lines tall**. Both conditions have to hold, because a loose text node beside an element is usually deliberate and this repo is full of the good kind: `.chip`, `.cat` and the results chain's own link key all put a swatch or a number next to a bare label in a flex row, one line, most of the container's width. The two populations are nowhere near each other — the broken rows measured 6 to 22 per cent of container width and 6.7 to 22.7 lines; every deliberate case is a single line. Verified by reintroducing the defect, which the guard reported on all four rows at both widths, and by removing it again. The page list is read from the filesystem, so a page added later is covered without anyone remembering.

## v10.288.0 — September 7, 2026 (The two newest Fundamentals get the diagram they were missing)

### For Learners

- **The results chain is now a chain.** Five links, four arrows, and where a programme's measurement stops carrying weight the arrow is drawn cut, with the words on it. The six programmes are the same chain six times over, so the thing the page is arguing, that the break falls in the same place in all six, is now something you can see rather than something you have to be told. Click any link for the instrument behind it.
- **Kabeer's three parts are drawn as the sequence they are.** Resources, then agency, then achievements, joined. Open any of the four Indian series and it tells you which of the three that series measures and what Kabeer says that part cannot settle on its own. The series and their sources are unchanged, and sit below.

### Fixed

- **The results chain and the empowerment page drew charts instead of the framework, the only two Fundamentals without an interactive diagram** (#1070). Every other page in the library draws the framework it teaches as a shape you can interact with: the wheel's twelve axes and three rings, the cube's three faces, the ladder's eight rungs, the capability chain, the two axes of practical and strategic gender needs, the asset pentagon, the barrier stack, the gap matrix. The two pages added last week drew evidence and left the framework in prose.

  On the results chain that mattered specifically. There was no chain in it: five bars, no nodes, no arrows, and the break rendered as a one-pixel vertical rule drawn only when the next state's weight fell by more than 20. The page's headline claim is that the chain breaks one link later, and a bar chart cannot show a break in a chain because it never draws one. On the empowerment page, `drawBands()` emitted three cards, two screens below prose reading "The three parts are a sequence and not a menu".

  Both now draw the framework first and keep the evidence below, which is what `capabilities.html` and `gender-needs.html` already did. Three things fell out of building it that are worth recording.

  **The diagrams are HTML, not SVG.** `js/ladder.js` has said why since it was written: "Renders the eight rungs as real `<button>`s (not SVG), so every target scales." Text inside an SVG is multiplied by the ratio of rendered width to `viewBox`, which is what produced the 5.2px labels in #1068 a day earlier. HTML has no such scaling, wraps and stacks by itself, and gives each node real button semantics without being handed them. The small multiples stay SVG and now carry **no text at all**: the five links are named once, in HTML, above the grid, and each figure carries a full sentence as its accessible name.

  **The chain reacts to its container, not to the window.** A `@media` rule would have been wrong here and quietly so. Five nodes and four arrows need about 670px across, and the narrow column of the two-column layout is **493px on a 1600px screen**, so a viewport rule would have kept the row horizontal and squeezed every node to 65px on the widest displays. Measured: 39px at a 900px viewport, 65px at 1280px and above. `@container` asks the question that actually matters, and the results chain also moved out of the two-column layout to a full width the row can use.

  **A new colour token, because the obvious one failed.** The severed link is marked in `--color-break`, added per theme (`#be123c` light, `#fb7185` dark). The existing `--color-accent-pink` could not do it: `#f093fb` is **2.04:1** on the light card, which is why every other use of it in `css/fundamentals.css` is a 4px border and never ink. As a break marker it would have been below the 3:1 a meaningful graphic needs and the 4.5:1 its label needs, in the default theme, on the one mark carrying the page's argument. Caught by measuring every text node in the diagram against its painted background at five widths in both themes, not by eye and not by axe.

## v10.287.0 — September 7, 2026 (Charts drawn at the size they are shown)

### For Learners

- **The results chain turns vertical on a phone.** Five bars side by side left about 55 pixels each and printed their labels at under six, so the chart was there and could not be read. Below 640 pixels it is now five full-width rows running down the page, with bar length carrying the same weight bar height carried across. Every row is a tappable target the whole width of the screen, including the short ones, which is where the argument is: PM-KISAN's outcomes bar is the shortest cell on the page and the one worth pressing.
- **The empowerment charts are drawn at the width they are given.** The axis labels were rendering at 5.2 pixels on a phone and 7.6 on a laptop, against a 9.5 declared in the source. They now render at the size they say.

### Fixed

- **Chart text on the two new Fundamentals pages rendered at 5.2px on a phone, and the results chain's bars were 7px tap targets** (#1068). Both charts draw into a fixed-width `viewBox` that the browser then scales into whatever column it lands in, and every font size inside an SVG is multiplied by that ratio. Measured in Chromium: on `/fundamentals/results-chain.html` a 560-unit chart lands in a 337px column at a 390px viewport, so a 9.5px tick renders at **5.71px**, and at 360px it is **5.20px**. `/fundamentals/empowerment.html` was worse, because its two figures stack in one column at every width: a 620-unit chart in a 493px column at **1280px** put the same 9.5px label at **7.55px**, small enough next to a 9.5 in the source to look deliberate.

  The results chain carried a second defect at those widths. Bar *height* encodes how the link is measured, so the weakest states are slivers: an `absent` bar is 8 per cent of the plot height, about **7px** tall in a 55px slot, far under the 24×24 minimum, and it is the cell the page is arguing about. Below 640px the chain is now drawn top to bottom, five rows with length carrying the weight, each row backed by a transparent full-width hit rect so a short bar is still a full target. Measured after: every target **343×30** at 390px and **313×28** at 360px, labels 12 to 15px, no horizontal overflow, desktop unchanged. The empowerment page computes its `viewBox` from the real column at render time, so the scale is **1.003** at 390px and **1.002** at 1280px, and its tick tilt and bottom margin adapt for the crowded indicators, which removed three label collisions at 390px and one at 1280px. Both pages redraw on a debounced resize, and only when the orientation actually changes, so the address bar collapsing on a mobile browser does not rebuild the SVGs.

  **Nothing was going to catch this.** `rules/testing.md` item 12 already records that axe does not evaluate SVG text contrast; size is the same blind spot, and both pages report zero axe violations at 390px in both themes with every label unreadable. pa11y does not look at SVG text either. The pages were built and reviewed at 1280px, where the results chain is legible and the empowerment page's 7.55px passes for a small caption.

## v10.286.0 — September 7, 2026 (The tour points at the button you can see)

### For Learners

- **The homepage tour tells you how to search on the device you are actually holding.** On a phone it points at the search icon and says to tap it, instead of telling you to press a key combination a phone does not have.

### Fixed

- **The homepage tour's search step pointed at a hidden element on desktop, and told phone visitors to press Ctrl+K** (#1066). The first half was a regression from the previous release: the new mobile search button carries the same `.ims-nav-btn` class as the desktop one, and `startTour()` picked steps by `!!document.querySelector(s.element)`, which returns the first match in DOM order. The mobile button is injected into `.nav-container` ahead of `.mobile-menu-toggle`, so it won at every width — including 1280px, where it is `display: none`. Measured in Chromium: at 1280px the selector resolved to the mobile button (hidden) while the real one sat visible at 118×30 a few pixels away. Nothing errored; the step simply highlighted nothing. The step is now two steps, one per breakpoint, each with a selector that can match only one button, and copy that matches the control it points at. Steps may set `whenVisible: true` to require the element to be rendered rather than merely present; only these two do. **Deliberately opt-in**: measured against the real homepage, requiring visibility for every step drops seven of ten on a phone, because the desktop nav items and the theme selector are `display: none` at 390px and live in the hamburger menu instead. Those seven do currently anchor to nothing on mobile, which is a real defect and is recorded in #1066 rather than fixed here, because repairing it changes what a phone visitor is shown. With the flag opt-in, each width keeps nine of ten steps and every step other than the search pair behaves exactly as before.

## v10.285.0 — September 7, 2026 (Theories of Development)

### For Learners

- **Theories of Development** — a new library at `/theories/`. Twelve theories about why some places are poor, each drawn as a causal chain you step through one layer at a time, so you watch the argument being assembled rather than meeting it finished.
- **The global canon and South Asian traditions in one catalogue.** Rostow, Lewis, dependency theory, the Washington Consensus, capabilities, institutions and randomised evaluation sit beside Gandhi, Ambedkar, the Nehru–Mahalanobis plan, Bardhan's dominant proprietary classes and the Chipko argument. Filter by tradition, topic or period, or search by thinker.
- **Every theory is set against the record.** Each page takes the theory's own claims one at a time and reports what the evidence shows, with a named source and a year. Kuznets looking for Rostow's take-off and not finding it; Schultz's influenza argument against Lewis; Banerjee and Iyer on colonial land tenure; the five per cent of Indian marriages that cross caste, forty years after Article 17.
- **Two new Fundamentals.** *The Results Chain* draws six large Indian programmes as the same five links, with each link marked by how it is actually measured. MGNREGA counts a person-day to the individual worker and the calendar day; whether the household was better off at the end of the year is measured by nobody. The same break falls in the same place in all six.
- **Resources, Agency, Achievements** puts Naila Kabeer's framework against Indian survey data, and draws every indicator beside the companion series that changes how it reads. Lifetime experience of spousal violence fell from 37.2 per cent to 29.1 across fifteen years; over the same three rounds the last-twelve-months figure went 23.0, 23.9, 24.0. Same survey, same table, one of them quoted.
- **Search now works on a phone.** The search button existed only inside a container the mobile stylesheet hides, so on a phone there was no way to reach site-wide search at all. There is now a search icon next to the menu button on every page.
- **Each theory points at the open-access reading for it.** Named entries in Development Discourses, linked by title and author: Thorat and Newman on caste for Ambedkar, Besley and Burgess on Indian land reform for Chipko, Heckman's revisit of randomisation for the randomistas, Nunn on the slave trades for dependency and institutions. Rostow carries none, because the library holds nothing that bears on stage theory and a forced link is worse than none.
- **Four placements per theory, and the reason for each.** Who allocates, what comes first, where hierarchy sits, who moves. The usual left-to-right axis separates Ambedkar from Nehru while they share most of their economics, so these ask what the theories on this shelf actually disagree about. The scores are ours and each page shows the sentence behind its own, so they can be argued with.

### Added

- `data/theories/` holds one JSON file per theory plus the shared vocabulary in `_meta.json`. `scripts/build-theories.py` generates the pages, `js/theories-data.js`, and the `/theories/` rows in `sitemap.xml` and `data/search-index.json`; `--check` runs in CI as the `theories` job. It refuses to build on an edge pointing at a node that does not exist, an axis scored without a note justifying it, evidence with no source or year, or a compare/contrast link to a theory that is not there. The edge check is the one that earns its keep: a renderer drops such an edge silently, so the diagram keeps looking finished while an arrow the argument depends on is missing.
- Two Fundamentals frameworks, taking the series to ten: `fundamentals/results-chain.html` with `js/results-chain-data.js` and `js/results-chain.js`, and `fundamentals/empowerment.html` with `js/empowerment-data.js` and `js/empowerment.js`. Both pages joined `tests/axe-accessibility.js`, `.pa11yci` and `scripts/stamp-assets.py`; `check-fundamentals-index.py` now reports ten and the series nav on all eight older pages was updated so the ten are one series rather than eight plus two.
- Every survey figure on the two new pages was pulled from the source rather than from memory or secondary reporting: the National Family Health Survey rounds through the DHS StatCompiler, the Periodic Labour Force Survey through the MoSPI API. That is how the decision-making figure on the empowerment page is 71.0 per cent for final say in all three decisions rather than the higher number that circulates, and how the flat twelve-month violence series was found at all.
- `data/development-discourses.json` and `scripts/sync-development-discourses.py`. Development Discourses is a separate repository, so a link into it is the kind of cross-reference that rots without anything here noticing. The 23 referenced resources are mirrored into a committed snapshot; `build-theories.py` refuses to build on an id that is not in it, and the sync script refuses to write if an id a theory still points at has disappeared from the source, rather than silently dropping the entry. Verified both ways with a fabricated id.
- `js/theories.js` lays the graph out and draws it, rather than shipping a pre-rendered image. A baked SVG carries its fills with it and this site has two themes; every fill and ink here comes from a token defined per theme in `css/theories.css`. `scripts/check-theories-contrast.py` reads those tokens and fails below 4.5:1 in either theme — including the *dimmed* state of completed steps, which is a composite against the canvas rather than a token pair, and which was set at 0.22 opacity and unreadable until the guard was pointed at it.
- `tests/mobile-search.js`, with the `mobile-search` job in CI. It measures the search affordance at a 390px viewport across the site's two navigation shapes and clicks it, asserting the modal opens with its input focused, that exactly one search button is visible at each width, and that neither shrinks below a tap target. It polls for the modal rather than sleeping, because on pages with the shared bar `search.js` is fetched on click and a fixed wait passes or fails by how fast the runner is. Verified by commenting out the fix, which it catches.
- The three new page shapes joined `tests/axe-accessibility.js` and `.pa11yci` instead of being left off both lists, and `theories/*.html` joined `scripts/stamp-assets.py`. The generator emits the same content hash the stamper would, so the two agree rather than rewriting each other.

### Fixed

- **Site-wide search was unreachable on mobile** (#1062). `js/search.js` injected its button into `.nav-buttons`, and `css/imx-main.css` sets that container to `display: none !important` below 768px, so on a phone the button sat in the DOM at **0×0** with the correct class and a working click handler. The hamburger menu carried no search entry either, and `Ctrl+K` is not something a phone offers. Every desktop check passed throughout, which is why it lasted: measured in Chromium on `/index.html`, the button is 118×30 and visible at 1280px and 0×0 at 390px. axe and pa11y would not have reported it — a zero-size element with a valid `aria-label` is a layout outcome, not a WCAG violation. There is now an icon-only button in `.nav-container`, which stays laid out at every width, shown only below the breakpoint that hides the other one. It carries `order: 98` because that bar sequences itself with flex `order` rather than DOM order, and a button left at the default renders to the left of the logo, which is where the first attempt put it.
- **The shared top bar's search button collapsed to an 18px sliver when its icon failed to load** (#1062). Below 720px that bar hides the text label, so the icon *is* the button, and `ic()` hides the `<img>` on error — one failed CDN fetch and search became a near-invisible 18×32 stub on every phone. Found by the new test rather than by eye. The search icon is now inline SVG rather than a CDN fetch, since it is the one control in that bar whose absence leaves nothing to press, and `.im-sc-btn` has a 34px floor below 720px so no icon button in the bar can shrink past a tap target.
- **The Fundamentals cards on `index.html` and `libraries.html` described four frameworks and 171 statistics; there are eight** (#1064). The homepage card also said "Open the wheel", inviting the reader into one page rather than into the library. Nothing covered them: `check-counts.py` reads `data/counts.json`, which has no Fundamentals entry, and `check-fundamentals-index.py` deliberately stopped at the library's own directory. Both cards now describe the library, and the guard was extended to the two entry points with a rule that is checkable rather than a number to maintain: those cards may not state a count at all. Verified by reintroducing "Eight clickable maps" (caught) and by repointing the homepage card at `wheel.html` (caught).

### Changed

- The Fundamentals series nav on all eight existing pages carries the two new frameworks, and the landing page heading counts ten. `check-fundamentals-index.py` was extended at the same time to cover the two cards that link into the library from outside it, with a rule that cannot go stale: those cards may not state a count.
- `--th-accent` on `/theories/` pages replaces `--color-primary-2` for small uppercase text. `#764ba2` measures **2.36:1** on the dark card, so a component that sets text in it raw fails AA in dark mode, which is what axe caught on `.dg-step`, `.ev-tag` and `.lg-arrow`. `css/fundamentals.css` does not have this problem and needed no change: the two places it sets text in that token are overridden to `#c9b8ff` (8.42:1) under both `[data-theme="dark"]` and `prefers-color-scheme`, and axe on Fundamentals pages in both dark paths reports zero contrast violations. An earlier draft of this entry said otherwise; see #1063, closed as invalid.

## v10.284.0 — September 3, 2026 (Icons that were never there)

### Fixed

- **Sixteen icon files and two stylesheets were requested from a CDN that has never had them** (#1060). Pages across Labs, courses and the catalog asked for Sargam icons by names the package does not publish — `si_Users`, `si_Task`, `si_Share`, `si_File`, `si_Database`, `si_Timer`, `si_Edit`, `si_Globe`, `si_Scale`, `si_Bulb`, `si_Folder`, `si_Accessibility`, `si_Check_ring` and `si_Check_tick_double` — and three pages linked a Sargam stylesheet, which the package does not ship at any version. Every one of those URLs returned 404, at the pinned 1.6.6 and at 1.6.7. Because each `<img>` carried `alt=""` and no layout depended on it, nothing errored and nothing moved: the icon was simply absent, on the Disability-Inclusive MEL, Systems Thinking and Livelihoods Value Chain studio badges, the "Rights & Justice" cards on Nothing About Us, the catalog's Programmes filter, and the assessment entries in the SEL and Media course navigation. The package publishes 433 Line icons; each reference now points at one that exists, chosen by what the surrounding content is about, and the three stylesheet links are gone. Verified by requesting all 131 distinct Sargam paths the site uses and confirming every one returns 200.

### Changed

- Browser libraries moved up, each pinned to an exact version: Supabase JS 2.112.3 to 2.114.0 (520 references), Chart.js 4.4.0 and 4.4.1 to 4.5.1 (57), Sargam Icons 1.6.6 to 1.6.7 (802). `Backups/` is deliberately left on the versions it was taken with. Checked in Chromium: `supabase.createClient` builds a working client on 2.114.0, and pages that paint charts on load still paint them. Two pages that draw nothing without live data behave identically on 4.5.1 and on 4.4.0, so that is how they were before, not a regression.
- The MCP server builds on TypeScript 7.0.2, up from 5.7. TypeScript 7 no longer picks up `@types/node` implicitly under `moduleResolution: Node16`, so `tsconfig.json` names it in `types` — the compiler's own suggested fix. Two advisories in a transitive `qs` were cleared at the same time; `npm audit` reports none.
- CI runs on current action majors, and the two jobs still pinned to Node 20 now use Node 22. GitHub had begun forcing Node 20 actions onto Node 24 with a deprecation warning on every run.

## v10.282.0 — September 2, 2026 (Deprivation travels in packs)

### For Learners

- **Deprivation travels in packs** — a new chart in The Long View. Six deprivations across all 706 districts, and only **21 clear all six**. The largest single group is 129 districts carrying five at once. The one they leave out is sanitation.
- **What went backwards** — between the two NFHS rounds, sanitation worsened in 20 districts and clean cooking fuel in 13. Women's anaemia worsened in 353 and children's in 401, and in 128 districts both worsened together.
- **A chart type worth knowing.** Both use an UpSet plot, which answers a question a Venn diagram cannot be drawn for past three sets and a bar chart actively hides: not how common each thing is, but how often they land on the same place. Each chart explains how to read it.

### Added

- `scripts/build-upset-data.py`, with the `upset-data` job in CI. It rebuilds both views from the committed NFHS district file and fails if the data file or the generated chart script has drifted from it.
- `upset()` in `js/longview-charts.js`, and `--chart-acc1` / `--chart-acc2` theme tokens. A filled mark needs 3:1 against the surface behind it and no single step clears that on both the white and the dark card, so each theme takes its own step from the same ramp.

### Fixed

- **The asset stamp did not cover The Long View** (#1056). Its per-chart page loads the shared chart engine, so fresh markup could pair with a previous deploy's script — the same stale-pairing the stamp was built to prevent, on a page it was not watching. A reader would get an empty box and no error. `the-long-view/*.html` is now stamped. Roughly 400 further pages (BookSummaries, the blog, DeepDives, Games and others) are still outside it; that is recorded in the script rather than quietly fixed here.

## v10.283.0 — September 1, 2026 (The subscription QR code comes back)

### Fixed

- **The subscription payment page loaded a script that returns 404, so the UPI QR code never drew** (#1054). `subscribe/pay/index.html` pinned `qrcode@1.5.3/build/qrcode.min.js`, and that version publishes no `build/` directory at all, so the URL had never resolved. The call to `QRCode.toCanvas` then threw a `ReferenceError` *before* its own error handler could run, which meant the page could not even show the "Could not draw QR — use the UPI ID above." message it already contained: a visitor got an empty box and no explanation. Everything above that line still ran, so the amount, the reference and the `upi://` button were correct and payment by UPI ID was still possible. Now pinned to `qrcode@1.5.1/build/qrcode.min.js`, a 23,738-byte browser bundle that declares `var QRCode` at top level, and the call site is guarded so a future CDN failure shows the fallback message rather than nothing. Verified in Chromium against all three cases: the old file with the real 404 painted 0 of 48,400 canvas pixels and logged `QRCode is not defined`; the new file paints all 48,400 with 22,879 dark modules and no console errors; the new file with the CDN forced to 404 shows the fallback line.

## v10.282.0 — September 1, 2026 (Course backups stop being public)

### Fixed

- **Two backup copies of the course content were readable, editable and deletable by anyone** (#1052). `course_content_backup_20260821` and `course_content_backup_20260821b`, taken on 21 August, were created with `CREATE TABLE AS`, which copies the rows but inherits neither the source table's row level security nor its policies. `course_content` itself is service-role-only and returns nothing to a visitor; the backups returned all 259 rows, 217 of them the gated `is_preview=false` module bodies with their full `content_html`, to anyone holding the anon key that ships in `js/config.js` with every page. A write probe returned `204` rather than `401`, so the rows could have been altered or deleted as well. Both tables now have RLS enabled with no policies and the inherited `anon` / `authenticated` grants revoked, matching `course_content`. No rows were changed or dropped. Exposure ran 21 August to 1 September; there is no access log that would say whether anyone read them.

### Changed

- **The anon-exposure guard could not see a table nobody had added to it.** `scripts/check-supabase-anon.py` probes a fixed list, so a table created after the script was written is outside the check by default, which is how these two went eleven days unnoticed. Both are now probed (nine table probes, up from seven). The underlying shape of the gap is the same fixed-list problem already documented for the axe and pa11y jobs in `rules/testing.md`: a probe that enumerates every `public` table with RLS off, rather than a list a person maintains, would catch the next one without anyone remembering.

## v10.281.0 — September 1, 2026 (The Libraries page becomes readable)

### Fixed

- **Accent-coloured text on the Libraries page was unreadable in the light theme** (#1048). The sky-blue `#0EA5E9` used for the eyebrow, the count chips and every "Browse →" measured **2.58:1** on the page background and 2.77:1 on a card, against the 4.5:1 WCAG AA needs. The same token also paints the card icons and the hover border, so darkening it outright would have changed the design; the text now takes a separate `--acc-ink` (`#0369A1`, 5.03:1 at worst, over the translucent chip fill) and the icons and border keep the original blue.
- **The group subtitles failed AA in both themes** (#1048) — `#65758B` at 4.38:1 in light, `#6B7A93` at 3.99:1 on a dark card. Now `#626F82` (4.75:1) and `#7A88A0` (4.84:1), still a step lighter than the body muted tone so the hierarchy survives.
- **"Skip to content" skipped the page's own heading** (#1049). The `<main>` landmark opened below the hero, so the h1 and its introduction sat outside it and a keyboard user taking the skip link landed past the title. The landmark now opens above the hero.

### Changed

- **The accessibility audit reported green while skipping most of its own page list.** `libraries.html` had never been in the list, which is why the contrast failures shipped — the pre-fix page reports 29 failing nodes in light and 4 in dark. Adding it turned out not to be enough. Three problems in `tests/axe-accessibility.js`, all of which made a page look audited when it was not:

  - A page that failed to load was marked `SKIPPED` and the run still passed. Only an *entirely* unreachable site failed, so one page dropping out was a yellow warning nobody reads. Measured on this repo: **14 of 44 page/variant runs audited, 30 skipped, verdict PASSED.** A page in the list that was never looked at now fails the run. With the load fixed below, the same suite audits **44 of 44** and still reports zero violations, so nothing was hiding behind the skips.
  - The skips were mostly not the pages' fault. The harness waits for the network to go idle, which never happens when a page pulls icons or fonts from a third-party CDN that is slow or blocked — `libraries.html` requests 16 icons from jsdelivr and left nine in flight indefinitely. The page itself is served fine and axe can audit it perfectly. It now falls back to `domcontentloaded` and audits the page instead of abandoning it.
  - A page that no longer exists loaded the server's 404 body, audited it, and reported PASS. A renamed or deleted page could sit in the list passing forever. The HTTP status is now checked.
- **The changelog gate that enforces all of this accepted a hex colour as an issue number** (#1050). `check-fix-issues.py` looked for `#\d+`, which matches the leading digits of `#0369A1` and `#38BDF8`. Of the three uncited entries above, it flagged one — the other two quoted colours and passed. It now rejects a number followed by a hex letter, while still accepting the three older entries that cite a bare `#NNN`.

## v10.280.0 — August 29, 2026 (The offline page gets you back)

### Fixed

- **The offline page overlapped its own text on every phone** (#1045). Its footer was pinned to the bottom of the viewport, so on any screen short enough for the content to reach the bottom it sat on top of the tip paragraph. It now follows the content and still holds the bottom when there is room. Checked at 360×640, 412×915 and 1180×900.
- **The offline page never recovered on its own** (#1045). It was a dead end with a "Try again" button, so a visitor who landed there during the domain outage had no way to know when the site came back except by tapping. It now re-checks the address it is standing in for every ten seconds and reloads itself the moment a real response arrives, plus an immediate check when the browser reports the connection back. `navigator.onLine` is not used as the test on its own: it reports whether the device has a link, not whether this site answers, and it was true throughout the outage.

## v10.279.0 — August 29, 2026 (The site works on any address again)

### Fixed

- **The site could only be browsed on one hostname** (#1042). About 6,200 of its own navigation links, across 248 pages, were written as `https://www.impactmojo.in/...` rather than `/...`. On the custom domain that works, so nothing ever looked wrong. It meant that on `impactmojo.netlify.app`, on a deploy preview, or on a local server, every link left for the canonical host — and when DNS for that domain went down, every page Netlify was still serving perfectly sent visitors nowhere and reported them offline. All in-site links are now root-relative, which resolves identically on the custom domain. `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph and Twitter tags, JSON-LD, the sitemap, the email templates and Open Badges credential identifiers stay absolute, because those are read off-site.
- **The AI opponents in the Games library fetched their data from the absolute domain** (#1042), so they silently fell back to the local engine on any other origin.
- **Four internal links were broken and invisible** (#1043), because the link checker skips external URLs and these were written as absolute ones: a `/fieldcases` page in the press kit that has never existed (link removed rather than invented), a doubled `/community/community`, a `/courses/publicpolicy/` that is really `/courses/pubpol/`, and a `/courses/powerBI/` directory with no index file.

### Added

- `scripts/make-links-origin-relative.py`, enforced in CI as the `origin-relative-links` job, so a hard-coded host cannot creep back in.

## v10.278.0 — August 29, 2026 (The hundred days)

### For Learners

- **MGNREGA Explorer** — the Act owes every rural household 100 days of paid work a year on demand. In 2025-26 the average household that worked got **42.7 days**, and **4.0%** reached the full hundred. Eight financial years, 757 districts, searchable by district or state.
- **The state spread is wide.** Mizoram averaged 91.3 days, Puducherry 24.3. Kerala got 27.3% of its working households to a full hundred; most states are under 5%.
- **One promise the programme does keep.** Women did **56.7%** of all person-days, well above the one-third floor the Act sets.
- **A year still running is labelled as one.** The year chips show how many months each has reported, and the page opens on the last complete year rather than ranking a one-month year against a twelve-month one.

### Added

- `scripts/fetch-mgnrega-data.py` and `scripts/build-mgnrega-explorer-data.py`, with the `mgnrega-data` job in CI.

### Corrected before release

- **All five data explorers had scrollable tables that a keyboard could not reach.** axe reported them clean because the tables sit inside a collapsed `<details>`; opening them first surfaced 14 violations across the five pages. Every scroll container is now focusable and named.

### Data notes

- The source's columns are **cumulative within the financial year**, so each year's figure is its last reported month rather than a sum of the months. Summing returns roughly six times the truth and still looks plausible. The build asserts the shape — 97.0% of month-to-month steps rise and the median district-year ends 16.9× where it started — and stops if the source ever switches to monthly flows.
- **From 2024-25 the source publishes a fresh snapshot of each district-month every day**, up to 31 rows for one district and month. The most complete snapshot of the final month is used; 346,412 repeat rows were collapsed.
- **The fortnight-payment measure is not shown.** The source publishes a column for the share of wages paid within 15 days, and it is not a percentage: median about 100, 95th percentile 1,143, maximum over 84 million. Every way of making it look like one amounts to keeping the districts that appear compliant, so the page says the measure is missing and why.
- The raw snapshot is 415,834 district-months and 266 MB, so it is not committed. `data/mgnrega-explorer.json` is; refresh with the fetch script.

## v10.277.0 — August 29, 2026 (What happens after a case is registered)

### For Learners

- **Case Outcomes Explorer** — NCRB 2023, state by state, on what happens to a case rather than how many there are: chargesheeting rate, conviction rate, and how much is still pending with the police and with the courts.
- **Six categories side by side.** All IPC crime, crime against women, atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, cyber crime, and crime against senior citizens.
- **Atrocities against Scheduled Castes reach a chargesheet more often than crime in general — 81.2% against 72.7% — and convict far less often, 31.9% against 54.0%.** The gap opens in court, not at the police station.
- **Cyber crime is the other outlier**, with 33.9% of disposed cases reaching a chargesheet against 72.7% for IPC crime as a whole.
- **The page refuses to rank states by crime, and says why at the top.** A registered case needs someone to go to a police station and someone there to write it down, so a state with a high count may be a state where reporting works. Counts measure reporting at least as much as they measure crime.

### Added

- `scripts/fetch-crime-data.py` and `scripts/build-crime-explorer-data.py`, with the `crime-data` job in CI.

### Data notes

- Rates are shown only for states with at least 100 cases at the relevant stage. Lakshadweep charge-sheeting 100% of four cases is not a fact about its police, and the states left out are named on the page rather than dropped quietly.
- Where NCRB publishes no state-wise court table — crime against women and atrocities against Scheduled Tribes — the court panels say so instead of rendering an empty chart.

## v10.276.0 — August 29, 2026 (What the air monitors measure)

### For Learners

- **Air Quality Explorer** — station-by-station readings from India's Central Pollution Control Board network: 502 continuous monitors across 265 cities, for PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, ozone, carbon monoxide and ammonia. Filter every station by name, city or state.
- **The network itself is the second story.** Stations per 10 million residents runs from Delhi's 26.8 to Jharkhand's 0.6, and six of India's 36 states and union territories have no station at all. A state with no station is not a state with clean air; it is a state with no measurement, and it can never appear in a ranking of the worst places to breathe.
- **The page says what hour it is showing.** These are readings from a single hour, not a daily or annual average, and the reading time sits at the top rather than being implied away.

### Added

- `scripts/fetch-aqi-data.py` and `scripts/build-aqi-explorer-data.py`, with the `aqi-data` job in CI. The build refuses to run if the snapshot mixes reading times, keeps a station's `NA` out of the average instead of counting it as zero — 9.2% of readings come back blank — and records how many of a city's stations reported each pollutant.

## v10.275.0 — August 29, 2026 (Who is actually in prison?)

### For Learners

- **Prisons & Undertrials Explorer** — of the 530,333 people held in Indian prisons on 31 December 2023, **73.5% had not been convicted of anything**. They were undertrials: in custody, waiting for a trial to finish.
- **Prisons hold 120.8% of the space they were built for**, and you can rank every state by occupancy or by prisoners per 100,000 residents.
- **How long people have already waited**, before any finding of guilt: 30.7% of undertrials have been in custody more than a year, and 33,398 for more than three.
- **Who they are.** Scheduled Castes are 16.6% of the population and 20.6% of undertrials; Scheduled Tribes 8.6% and 10.0%. A scatter puts each state's population share against its undertrial share, with a diagonal where the two would match. 64% of undertrials left school before Class X or never attended, and bail costs money.
- **A right that mostly went unused.** Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure entitles an undertrial who has served half the maximum sentence to release. In 2023, 1,384 people were recorded as eligible and 656 were released.
- **The queue outside**, which is why the wait is long: 44.9 million cases pending in the district courts, grouped by how long they have already been pending, and ranked per 1,000 residents.

### Added

- `scripts/datagov.py` — one shared client for data.gov.in, used by every explorer built on it. Refuses to return a short read: a truncated fetch is the failure that does not look like one, since the file stays valid, the page renders, and a tenth of India is quietly missing.
- `scripts/fetch-justice-data.py` and `scripts/build-justice-explorer-data.py`. The build step refuses to write when the join is wrong, and CI re-runs it as the `justice-data` job.

### Corrected before release

- **The CSR explorer showed the light palette to anyone who had never touched the theme toggle**, including a visitor whose phone is set to dark. It styled `html[data-theme="dark"]` only, and a visitor with no stored preference carries no such attribute. Every other explorer already handled this.
- **The CSR explorer was also missing the shared top bar and the translation control** that every other explorer loads.

### Data notes

- Two source defects were caught before publishing, and both would have shipped wrong numbers with nothing on screen to show for it. Every NCRB table carries three total rows, so summing a column returns exactly three times the real figure. And the Scheduled Tribe columns of the Census SC/ST table are scrambled across rows — Kerala's row carries Madhya Pradesh's ST population and its percentage, so the row checks out against itself and the column still sums to the correct national total. Plotted, it put Kerala at 46% Scheduled Tribe against a real 1.5%. Scheduled Tribe figures now come from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs table, the two sources must agree nationally before either is used, and any state that fails the check is dropped and named on the page.

## v10.274.0 — August 29, 2026 (Where India's CSR money actually goes)

### For Learners

- **CSR Explorer** — five years of India's mandated corporate social responsibility spending, 2018-19 to 2022-23, from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Which states received it, which causes absorbed it, and how much was assigned to no state at all.
- **The money tracks income, not need.** Plotted against per-capita state income, CSR per resident correlates **+0.87**: Delhi received about **₹884 per person** in 2022-23, Bihar **₹23**. If giving followed need the line would slope the other way.
- **Education and health took 56.4% of everything** — both causes where public provision is already strongest in the states that receive the most.
- **Nearly a quarter of all CSR belongs to no state.** ₹7,030 crore of the ₹29,988 crore spent in 2022-23 sits under "PAN India", "PAN India (Other Centralized Funds)" and "NEC/Not Mentioned". The explorer shows those rows rather than dropping them or spreading them across states, either of which would change every figure on the page.

### Added

- `scripts/fetch-csr-data.py` — snapshots the four data.gov.in series the explorer joins (CSR by state, CSR by sector, Census 2011 population, per-capita NSDP) into `data/csr-india.json`. Re-run to refresh.
- `scripts/build-csr-explorer-data.py` — joins them, and refuses to write if the join is wrong. Both source tables carry a **"Total" row**, so summing the column double-counts exactly; the script checks that the two series agree on the national total and that the parts sum to it, and stops with the two figures if they do not. It also injects the result into `csr.html`, so the page and the data file cannot drift apart. Enforced in CI via the `csr-data` job.

### Corrected before release

- `.faint` on the explorer measured **3.05:1** in light — the eyebrow, the control labels, the axis ticks and the source line, all real text. Now 5.03:1. The sitewide theme-contrast gate reads `css/*.css` and never saw it, which is the point of measuring rather than trusting a green run.

## v10.273.0 — August 27, 2026 (A guard for the bug that shipped a button nobody could read)

### Fixed

- **Five Dataverse entries pointed at bare GitHub organisation pages that do not exist** (#1036). Gmail, Notion, Airtable and Docker MCP are repointed at their real repositories, each confirmed with `git ls-remote` first — Notion's is the company's own. MCP Analytics is removed: nothing matching its description exists, and the one live thing with that name is a different product (web analytics, not the "50+ ML and statistics tools" the entry described), so substituting it would have been worse than removing it. The sixth link, to d-saikrishna's profile, is correct as it stands — the account was verified and the entry covers several projects rather than one repo, which the description now says. Dataverse 335 → 334.
- **An unclosed `<div>` in the p-values post** — the same defect as #1033, sitting latent with no visible symptom. 32 divs opened, 31 closed.

### Added

- `scripts/check-html-nesting.py` — every element that opens in a blog post must close, in order. #1033 shipped an unreadable Substack button because a `</div>` was lost when a new post was spliced into an existing post's shell, and **no existing guard could see it**: the page rendered, and the h1 and viewport checks both passed. Proved by re-introducing the exact defect and confirming the guard names the file, the element and the line. Enforced in CI via the `html-nesting` job, and written up as item 18 in `rules/testing.md`.

## v10.272.0 — August 27, 2026 (The Union Budget explorer now points at the analysis)

### For Learners

- **Nine spending heads in the Union Budget Explorer now carry a link to ResGov's analysis of that ministry.** Agriculture, education, health, rural development, urban development, defence, social welfare, energy and food each get a **brief** chip beside the head name; hover it to see every brief for that head, across years. Education has five, health has eight.
- **All 50 briefs are reachable from a panel below the table**, grouped by head, with two honest extra columns: three cover the budget as a whole rather than one head, and fourteen — on water, environment, tribal affairs and city-level clean-air finance — cut across several heads or sit under none. Nothing is orphaned and nothing is forced into a head it does not belong to.
- **The page says why the fit is approximate.** ResGov organises by ministry, department or scheme; the budget's expenditure table is organised by function. The two do not line up exactly, and the panel opens by saying so. The links go to ResGov and the analysis is theirs, which the panel also states.

### Changed

- The brief chip uses a dedicated `--rg-ink` token rather than the page's teal accent, which measured **3.35:1 in light and 3.99:1 in dark** at 10.5px — both under the 4.5:1 minimum. It is now 4.91:1 and 7.98:1, measured in the browser rather than assumed.

## v10.271.0 — August 27, 2026 (PLFS moves to calendar 2025, and ResGov joins the Dataverse)

### For Learners

- **The PLFS Workforce Explorer now runs on calendar year 2025.** State rankings, the table and the pay view use the latest annual figures: women's labour-force participation is **40.0%** against men's **79.1%**. You can switch the rankings and the table back to 2023-24 with the underlined year.
- **The trend view shows both survey designs side by side, with the break marked.** PLFS moved from a July–June cycle to a January–December one under a redesigned, much larger sample, so the two runs are drawn as separate lines with a dashed rule between them. A single line across that join would be a trend that never happened. Women's participation climbed 23.3% → 41.7% on the old basis, then 33.9% → 40.0% on the new one.
- **Pay figures are now annual rather than a single quarter.** The old series only published earnings by survey quarter; the calendar series publishes a yearly figure. Women's average gross earnings from self-employment are **₹6,374 a month against men's ₹17,914** — about 36%.
- **ResGov joins the Dataverse.** The Foundation for Responsive Governance publishes 50 ministry-by-ministry Union Budget briefs — agriculture, rural development, education, health, Jal Shakti, women and child development, housing, defence, and named schemes like PMAY-Gramin — plus working papers on welfare delivery and state capacity. Read them beside the head-level numbers in the Union Budget explorer.

### Changed

- Two things on the PLFS page that could not move to 2025, both now labelled rather than quietly left stale: the **job-security view stays on 2023-24**, because MoSPI does not publish that breakdown on the calendar series (the API returns an error for it); and the **confidence-interval whiskers appear on the 2023-24 rankings only**, because the relative standard errors exist in that report's Appendix B and have no published equivalent for 2025. The 2025 view draws none rather than borrowing the old ones, and the legend says so instead of promising whiskers that are not there.

## v10.270.0 — August 27, 2026 (NFHS State Explorer, and eight dead links out of the Dataverse)

### For Learners

- **NFHS State Explorer** — India's health and nutrition indicators by state, with **rural and urban shown separately** instead of rolled into one figure. Published state tables give you the combined number, and on a wide gap that number describes neither half of the state. Kerala's child stunting went from 19.7% to 23.4% between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 — but that is 19.5% to 26.4% rural against 19.8% to 20.1% urban. Nearly all of it is rural, and the combined figure shows about half. 136 indicators, 39 states and union territories, both rounds, 27,084 published figures.
- **Four ways in.** Rank states by the size of the rural–urban gap; track what changed between the rounds for each half separately (Assam's stunting fell 2 points in rural areas and rose 7.5 in urban); read one state's whole profile on any theme; or list the full table and download it as CSV.
- **It says what it cannot tell you.** Five units — Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, and the Daman & Diu territories — were reorganised between the rounds, so the change view leaves them out rather than compare two different places. Estimates NFHS prints in brackets because they rest on 25–49 unweighted cases are kept and marked; suppressed and unpublished figures show as a dash. Nothing is interpolated.

### Fixed

- **Eight Dataverse entries pointed at URLs that do not exist** (#1036) — seven GitHub repositories and one 404 on J-PAL's site. Five were repointed to the correct location, each confirmed with `git ls-remote` first; three had no replacement and were removed, including one that was a duplicate of another entry's URL. The Dataverse goes 337 → 334.

### Changed

- The Data Room grows to 14 explorers; the existing NFHS explorer is now named **NFHS District Explorer** to distinguish it from the state one.

## v10.269.0 — August 26, 2026 (The NFHS explorer in the Dataverse now covers states too)

### Changed

- **The NFHS-5 vs NFHS-6 explorer in the Dataverse has grown a state layer**, and our entry had not caught up. It now carries 101 indicators for states and UTs alongside the 93 district ones, and a second author. The entry is renamed to *NFHS State & District Explorer*, credited to Nand Lal Mishra and Swati Sneha, and still says plainly that it is an independent project rather than an official IIPS or MoHFW release, and that NFHS-6 district results are still being released.

## v10.268.0 — August 26, 2026 (Rewriting the two new posts, and a button nobody could read)

### Fixed

- **The newsletter button on both new posts was unreadable** (#1033). Assembling the pages from an existing post's shell dropped the `</div>` that closes `.article-content`, so the share and newsletter blocks ended up inside the article body and inherited its `.article-content a { color: var(--accent-color); text-decoration: underline }` rule — blue link text on the blue gradient, underlined. Both posts now close the div, and the button matches every other post.

### Changed

- **Both posts rewritten.** The first drafts read as machine-written: a bolded lead-in on almost every paragraph, aphoristic fragment closers, "it is not X, it is Y" constructions, and rhetorical imperatives. They are now ordinary prose, and the titles are plainer — *The judgment you cited may have been overruled* and *What India's unemployment rate hides about who works*. No figure, source or argument changed; the diagrams are the same.

## v10.267.0 — August 26, 2026 (Duplicate ids in the search index)

### Fixed

- Three ids in `data/search-index.json` were each carrying two different pages (#1031). `BLOG037` predated today; `BLOG038` and `BLOG039` were introduced yesterday by the same mistake that produced the first — the next id was taken from the id of the *last* blog entry in the array rather than the maximum over the file, and the array is not sorted by id, so the last blog entry read `BLOG037` while the highest in the file was `BLOG061`. A fourth collision (`nfhs-district-explorer`, used by both the in-house explorer and the independent NFHS-5-vs-6 project) is fixed too.

### Added

- `scripts/check-search-coverage.py` now fails on any repeated `id`. Coverage is compared by url, so id collisions were invisible to every guard we had, and nothing else in the repo reads the id field at all — search kept working throughout, which is why nobody noticed. Urls are deliberately not checked for uniqueness: many entries point at the same page under different fragments (every judgment at the docket, every dataverse resource at `dataverse.html`), so a url check would fail on correct data. Proved by re-introducing the exact `BLOG038` collision and confirming the guard caught it.

## v10.266.0 — August 26, 2026 (Two posts: the law that moved, and the column nobody prints)

### For Learners

- **The Law You Cited May Not Be the Law Any More** — a Supreme Court judgment was struck down in May 2025, recalled in November 2025, and reheard in July 2026. For six months citing it was right; for the eight after that it did not exist. Nothing in anybody's files changed on any of those dates. The post covers why development documents carry stale case law longer than most sectors, the four things worth checking before you cite a judgment, and what became free to check this year — the Supreme Court's own signed PDFs as open data, India Open Law's 12.8 million judgments and 813,168 tribunal matters, and eCourts for the district courts. Two diagrams.
- **India's Unemployment Rate Is 3.1%. That Is Not the Useful Number.** — read the unemployment column by social group on its own and Scheduled Tribes look like the group faring best in India's labour market. Put labour-force participation next to it and the picture reverses, by twenty points. The post explains why the two rates have different denominators, and sets out the two rules the thirteen data explorers ended up following: never show a headline number without the thing that changes what it means, and say plainly what the page cannot tell you. Two diagrams, and an honest account of what following those rules cost us.

## v10.265.0 — August 26, 2026 (Six judgments read off the court's own PDFs, and the same labour market read by social group)

### For Learners

- **Six more judgments in the Development Law Docket, taking it to 109** — and this batch was verified differently. Each one is linked to the Supreme Court's own signed PDF, released as open data, rather than to a search result. Among them: the November 2024 demolition judgment, which requires fifteen days' written show cause before a structure comes down; the ruling that made school fire and building safety a condition of the right to education; the RTI judgment that gives a student the right to inspect their own evaluated answer sheet; the direction that every government school must have a functioning toilet; and the rule that a school's own governing body cannot be treated as its employer's substitute.
- **How to read a judgment's identity.** Every one of the six carries the court's neutral citation, its CNR number, the decision date and the presiding judge as printed in the document itself. If you cite one of these in a proposal or a submission, those four things are what a reader can check you against.
- **The PLFS Workforce Explorer now reads the same labour market by social group.** Unemployment barely moves between Scheduled Tribes (2.1%), Scheduled Castes (3.3%), OBCs (3.0%) and the residual "Others" category (3.7%). Participation moves by twenty points, in the opposite direction. Read the unemployment column alone and you would conclude Scheduled Tribes are faring best; read it with participation and you get a different programme.
- **The sharpest version is among women.** Scheduled Tribe women have the highest participation of any group (62.6%) and the lowest unemployment (1.7%). Women in the "Others" category have the lowest participation (31.0%) and the highest unemployment (4.7%) — both on the same row. A targeting decision made off the unemployment rate would reach the wrong households.

### Added

- `scripts/check-judgment-sources.py` — resolves every judgment `source_url` that points at the Supreme Court open-data bucket, so a mistyped or guessed PDF path fails loudly instead of shipping as a dead link. Runs in CI as the `judgment-sources` job on the daily schedule and on demand, alongside `supabase-anon`; it hits a third-party service, so it does not gate pull requests.

### Changed

- The PLFS explorer's "newer data available" note now says which part of the calendar-year 2025 series is already on the page, instead of only saying the page has not been rebuilt on it.

## v10.264.0 — August 26, 2026 (The judgment that was struck down, recalled, and reheard)

### For Learners

- **Both ends of the Vanashakti litigation are now in the Docket, and they disagree with each other.** In May 2025 the Supreme Court struck down the two instruments that let a project built without environmental clearance be regularised afterwards, holding that clearance after the fact is alien to environmental law. That judgment was recalled on review in November 2025 by two judges to one. On rehearing, on 29 July 2026, the Court split the difference: the 2017 Notification is valid, the 2021 Office Memorandum is quashed prospectively, clearances already granted stand unless someone challenges them one by one, and no fresh applications will be entertained.
- **Why both are listed.** For fourteen months the law was the opposite of what it is now. Anyone who advised a community, drafted an objection or planned a campaign on the 2025 judgment was working from a judgment that no longer exists — and the Docket's whole purpose is to make that visible rather than leave the older, stronger-sounding ruling sitting there looking current. The 2025 entry is marked recalled and points at the 2026 one.

## v10.263.0 — August 26, 2026 (The Docket reaches 101)

### For Learners

- **Twenty-four more judgments, taking the Docket to 101.** Among them: the seven-judge Bench that allowed states to sub-classify within the Scheduled Castes and overruled the case that had barred it; the prison judgment that struck down caste-based segregation and ordered every state to rewrite its manual; the accessibility ruling that made the disability guidelines mandatory instead of advisory; the POCSO judgment closing the possession loophole, and the one that overturned the "skin to skin" reading; the rule that a settlement cannot be cleared without a survey and meaningful engagement with the people living in it; and the four-part test that makes access to justice a right — a forum must exist, be reachable, be timely, and be affordable.
- **The identity of survivors, and what it means for your reporting.** A 2018 judgment prohibits disclosing the identity of victims of sexual offences, including children. A case study, photograph, grant report or post that lets someone be identified is not a communications judgement call.
- **Manual scavenging, three years after the landmark direction.** A compliance order from January 2026 shows what enforcement actually looks like: the ₹30 lakh figure for a sewer death being claimed case by case, a district survey still unfinished, and a court that has not let go. If you work on sanitation-worker safety, the live orders carry the obligations, not the 2023 judgment alone.
- **A public interest petition is held to a standard now.** Four judgments set what a court asks before it hears you: who is really behind the petition, whether the contents are accurate, and whether this is a policy disagreement dressed as a public grievance.

## v10.262.0 — August 26, 2026 (The Docket learns what a court is still doing)

### For Learners

- **You can now filter the Docket by what stage a matter is at, not just whether the holding stands.** Those are different questions and the Docket was only answering one. A case can be good law and still live, with a court issuing fresh directions year after year — the right-to-food litigation, the migrant-workers matter, the forest-governance case. Five entries are now marked as matters the court is still seized of, and you can pull up just those.
- **And by layer** — the law governing how organisations themselves operate (foreign funding, tax exemption, RTI exposure, how a public interest petition must be brought) versus the rights law in the areas we work in. Eight entries sit in the first group.
- **Five judgments added, including a pair that shows why the Docket exists.** *Pune Municipal Corporation* (2014) was the authority on which a great many old land acquisitions were reopened and land returned to owners — and it was overruled in 2020 by *Indore Development Authority*, which narrowed the rule sharply. Both are now in, each pointing at the other. Anyone still working from advice given before March 2020 needs to know the ground moved. Also added: the RTI test for whether an organisation is a "public authority" at all, the standard a public interest petition is now held to, and the charitable-status rule for organisations that charge fees.

### Changed

- **The Docket's filter row fits a phone again.** Adding two filters took it to seven controls, each on its own line on a narrow screen, which pushed the first judgment most of a screen further down. They now sit two to a row below 560px.

## v10.261.0 — August 26, 2026 (The Docket stops narrating itself)

### Changed

- **The note at the foot of the Law Docket is half the length and says only what is true now.** It had grown a paragraph explaining that an earlier version of itself had given a wrong reason, and another announcing what was going to be added next. Neither is something a reader came to the page for: what the correction was belongs in this changelog, and what is coming next belongs nowhere until it ships. It now says which courts are covered and why district courts are not, in about eighty words.

## v10.260.0 — August 26, 2026 (A wrong reason, corrected)

### Fixed

- **The Docket said district court decisions "are not published in a form that can be cited". That is not true, and it should not have been written.** Every district court has its own site, the eCourts services carry judgments, and much of it is mirrored where it can be linked and checked line by line. The note now says so, and gives the two reasons that actually apply: a district court decision binds the parties in front of it and nobody else, so it cannot settle what an organisation elsewhere may or must do; and most of what district courts decide is private people's family and criminal matters, which we will not summarise on a public teaching site to illustrate a point. (#1023)

### For Learners

- **A farmer's accident claim, refused by the insurer and recovered in a district consumer forum.** The widow of a farmer claimed under the Gopinath Mundhe Farmers Accident Scheme through the Taluka Agriculture Officer; the insurer repudiated it as a heart attack rather than an accident. The District Consumer Forum at Aurangabad ordered ₹2 lakh with interest, and the State Commission dismissed the insurer's appeal. It is in the Docket because the route matters as much as the outcome — the claim went in through an agriculture officer, was refused there, and was won in a forum an ordinary claimant can actually reach. For anyone advising scheme beneficiaries, a repudiation letter is the start of a process, not the end of one.

## v10.259.0 — August 26, 2026 (The docket leaves the Supreme Court)

### For Learners

- **The Law Docket now covers High Courts and tribunals, not only the Supreme Court**, and has a court filter so you can see what is there from each. Five judgments open it up. *Laxmi Mandal* (Delhi High Court, 2010), where two women below the poverty line were denied maternity entitlements and the Court treated it as a violation of the rights to health and food rather than a service failure — and treated the schemes as one enforceable whole, so a gap in one is not answered by another. *Social Jurist* (Delhi High Court, 2007), holding private hospitals to the free-treatment conditions attached to the public land they were given, which is the reasoning that applies to any organisation given premises on a stated public purpose. *Naz Foundation* (Delhi High Court, 2009), read down Section 377 — carried with its full later history, because it was set aside in 2013 and only vindicated in 2018 by a different judgment, and that is the thing worth knowing before you rely on a High Court ruling. *Sarang Yadwadkar* (National Green Tribunal, 2013), which stopped a municipal road inside a mapped flood line and made the line bind the authority granting permission, not only the builder. And *Vardhaman Kaushik* (National Green Tribunal), as a worked example of what years of continuing supervision over air quality actually looks like.
- **The page now says why district court decisions are absent**, instead of listing them as excluded. They are not systematically published as citable documents, so there is usually nothing to link to and nothing to check a summary against; where a trial court decision does matter it is often readable only through the appellate judgment reviewing it, as with the Bhopal magistrate's convictions of 2010. An entry sourced to another court's account of a decision would not meet the standard the rest of the docket is held to, so none was added on that basis.

## v10.258.0 — August 26, 2026 (Data Dives are now Data Notes)

### Changed

- **Data Dives have been renamed Data Notes.** They sat next to Deep Dives and sounded like a variant of them, when the two are different things: a Deep Dive is a curated, annotated reading list from a named scholar, and a Data Note is a worked analysis of one public dataset testing a single claim. Data Dives was the one to rename — it is the smaller collection, and "deep dive" is ordinary English worth keeping. Every old `/DataDives/` link redirects to the new path, so nothing you have bookmarked or shared will break. Earlier changelog entries have been updated to the new name too, so searching for it finds the whole history.

### Fixed

- **Two pages were quoting the wrong number of them.** One said six and another said seven, when there are eleven. Nothing was checking, because this was the one content type with no canonical count. It has one now, and the count guard that covers everything else covers it too — so the next time one is added, any page still showing the old number is named. (#1020)

## v10.257.0 — August 26, 2026 (Diagrams that look like diagrams)

### For Learners

- **The webinar page now carries what people have said about our workshops** — four notes from participants, quoted as we received them and published without names or organisations.
- **Teaching Principles is reachable from the site footer and the Learn menu.** It was linked from exactly one page since it went up, which is close to unpublished.

### Changed

- **The Law Docket no longer says High Court and tribunal decisions "are not included".** That phrasing reads as a policy decision when the truth is narrower: every judgment collected so far happens to be a Supreme Court one. The page now says that, and says plainly that High Courts decide most development law that reaches a courtroom and are worth adding.

### Fixed

- **The essay's diagrams had stopped being diagrams.** Fixing their unreadability on phones (#1014) meant redrawing them in HTML, and that rewrite dropped every line the figures were made of — the arrows between steps, the drop-lines showing where a gate can stop the process, the connector into the result. What was left was a stack of text boxes. They are diagrams again, with the connectors drawn in a way that survives a narrow screen, and the third figure now shows arithmetic's usefulness shrinking to nothing across its three panels rather than only asserting it. (#1018)
- **On a phone, the multiplication signs in the first diagram were invisible.** A leftover style rule from the previous version hid them below 620px, so the row that exists to show effect size × reach × probability ÷ cost showed four unlabelled boxes instead. Every connector is now checked at four screen widths rather than assumed. (#1018)

## v10.256.0 — August 26, 2026 (MEL Practice Series, September to October)

### For Learners

- **The MEL Practice Series is now on the events page** — six Saturday sessions across September and October, each 45 minutes, online, capped at 10 seats and with no recording. Theory of Change without the jargon (5 Sept), building an indicator that actually measures something (12 Sept), from survey to dashboard (19 Sept), AI for M&E (26 Sept), gender-disaggregated data beyond the checkbox (3 Oct), and sampling for real-world baselines (10 Oct). Each card shows its date, level and fee, and the announcement is downloadable as a PDF.
- **The page now distinguishes the paid series from the standing clinics.** The six sessions with confirmed dates appear at the top with their fee; the four clinics not in this run stay below, free to request as before. A session cannot appear in both lists, and once a date has passed it drops out of the series on its own — when the run ends the whole block hides itself and all ten clinics return to the standing list, so nothing on the page has to be edited afterwards.

### Changed

- **The events page no longer describes every session as free.** The hero, the page description, the social preview and the catalog entry all said "free, live online sessions", which stopped being true the moment a paid series went on the page. All four now say which sessions carry a fee and which do not.

## v10.255.0 — August 26, 2026 (How we teach, written down)

### For Learners

- **A Teaching Principles page** — the twenty-four rules every ImpactMojo course, lab and game is built by, in one place. The challenge equation we use instead of differentiation; why prerequisite knowledge gets checked rather than assumed, and why the quantitative floor is the prerequisite most often skipped; teaching what a concept is *and* what it is not; building a diagram in front of people rather than reading a slide aloud; six named routes through an explanation; retrieval as a routine rather than an activity; interleaving; withdrawing support as knowledge grows; whole-class feedback instead of written comments; and slowing an activity down until it teaches something. Adapted from Adam Boxer's *Teaching Secondary Science* and the cognitive science behind it, with sources listed. Three principles are marked as places where teaching social science needs something different — misconceptions here are positions rather than errors, everyday words carry technical meanings that quietly mislead, and values are part of the content rather than noise to strip out. It ends with four things we are still bad at.

### Fixed

- **Case cards in the Law Docket and all six law guides were unreadable in dark mode.** They rendered white text on a white card — a contrast ratio of about 1.13 to 1, so the text was present, selectable and invisible. Two colour variables used throughout those pages had never been defined anywhere in the site, so every use fell back to a light-mode colour whatever theme the reader had chosen. Neither accessibility check would have caught it: both run the light theme at desktop width only. (#1016)

## v10.254.0 — August 26, 2026 (The essay, rewritten and sourced)

### For Learners

- **The essay on deciding what to fund has been rebuilt around principles rather than one organisation's method.** It no longer reads as Singer versus a named framework. It sets out the strongest form of the case for letting cost-effectiveness decide, five objections that defeat it, and then eight working principles that keep the counting while withdrawing its authority to conclude — count and publish your assumptions; eliminate with arithmetic rather than select with it; gate rather than multiply when the variance falls on someone else; put the affected person's judgement inside the measure; use a counterfactual you can act on; track trajectories as well as interventions; protect a line for work no institution wants done; and ask what would have to be true for this to be wrong. Every principle carries its own failure mode.
- **Every claim now names its source.** Singer, Rawls, Nozick, Williams, Pogge, Young, Sen, Nussbaum, Chambers, Scott, Deaton, Cartwright and Hardie, Bostrom, Klein, Strathern, the Miguel–Kremer deworming study with its 2015 replications and the Cochrane review, the Core Humanitarian Standard, Building State Capability, the Human Rights Watch report on Rohingya biometric data, and CARE's published evidence strategy — cited inline and collected in a reference list at the end.

### Fixed

- **The essay's diagrams were unreadable on a phone.** They were drawn as SVG on a 720-unit canvas, so on a 390px screen their labels rendered at about five pixels — present in the page, invisible in practice. They are now laid out in HTML, so they reflow to a single column on a narrow screen and the text stays at full size. Colours are set per theme, because the amber and teal used for the stop and go states each fell below the contrast floor on one of the two backgrounds. (#1014)
- **The Law Docket showed a heading announcing what is missing, over a list saying nothing is missing.** "What is deliberately not here" has been rendering above the sentence "Nothing is currently set aside" ever since the last two entries under it were moved or removed. The section now stays hidden until something is actually set aside; the mechanism that names exclusions is unchanged. The coverage note below it no longer says "this first release" — there have been several, and all 66 judgments are still Supreme Court, so the fact was fine and only the framing was stale. (#1015)

## v10.253.0 — August 26, 2026 (Dividing good by money — superseded by v10.254.0)

### For Learners

- **A long essay on how to decide what to fund** — Peter Singer's argument and CARE's cost-per-outcome framework, read side by side. Both divide good by money, so the essay does not pretend one counts and the other doesn't. It sets out what Singer gets right and will not stop being right about, then five things actually wrong with the framework built on him: aggregation erases the separateness of persons, the measurement gradient decides more than the ethics does, the person holding the ruler is not the person living the outcome, politics gets laundered into technique, and multiplying through uncertainty eventually multiplies through a catastrophe. It then does the same to CARE's five gates, including the one nobody criticises — scaling only where a government or market will adopt the work would have ruled out the manual scavenging petition, the mid-day meal order and Samatha. Ends with what actually changes on a Tuesday morning.

## v10.252.0 — August 25, 2026 (Five more judgments, and one note removed)

### For Learners

- **Five judgments join the Law Docket**, taking it to 66 — in the areas it was thinnest. Safai Karamchari Andolan, where the Court set ₹10 lakh compensation for a sewer death and made entering a sewer without safety gear a crime even in an emergency. The Asiad workers case, which held that paying below minimum wage is itself forced labour under Article 23. Narmada Bachao Andolan, which requires rehabilitation to keep pace with each rise in a dam's height. And the two Great Indian Bustard judgments read as a pair: the 2021 order to put power lines underground, and the 2025 judgment that replaced it with a mapped, staged regime after an expert committee reported. That pair is the clearest example in the docket of a court revisiting its own direction once evidence of implementation arrives.
- **A note about the right-to-food litigation has been removed.** It said the docket's two orders from that petition should not be read as the whole case. True, but nothing else in the docket carries a note explaining that one judgment is not the whole of a subject, and the page already says coverage is the Supreme Court only. It was left over from an earlier fix rather than written on purpose.

## v10.251.0 — August 25, 2026 (Eight years of Union spending)

### For Learners

- **The Union Budget Explorer now goes back eight years.** Actual spending by head from 2017-18 to 2024-25, beside the current budget — so you can see that interest on past borrowing more than doubled, transport quadrupled, and education rose 38% in rupees that were themselves losing value. Only the current year is published as a spreadsheet; the earlier years were read out of the budget PDFs, and the page says which document each figure came from. It is candid about what cannot be compared: heads get renamed, split and merged, so a blank means the budget changed what it published, not that spending stopped. Where a head does not appear in every year, no change figure is shown at all.

## v10.250.0 — August 25, 2026 (Where the Union rupee goes)

### For Learners

- **A Union Budget Explorer** — what the Government of India collects and what it spends it on, head by head, with 2024-25 actuals beside the 2025-26 budget, its mid-year revision, and the 2026-27 budget. Enter what you paid in income tax and it works out your share of defence, interest, education, health, rural development and every other head. It says plainly what that number is not: taxes on income are about 27% of Union receipts, nothing marks one rupee as yours, and the figure is a proportion rather than a trace. Interest on past borrowing is the single largest head at ₹14.04 lakh crore — more than defence, education and health — and the page explains why that is debt service and not a programme.

## v10.249.0 — August 24, 2026 (An empty list is not a finding)

### Fixed

- **The CSR law guide said no landmark CSR litigation exists. It did not know that.** It is the one law guide with no case in the docket, and the page turned that absence into a claim about Indian case law — "this statute has not yet produced the kind of landmark litigation that reshapes practice" — which nobody had checked. On a page about someone's statutory obligations, that errs toward false reassurance. It now says what is true: this docket covers the Supreme Court only and is deliberately narrow, so an empty list is the limit of what is collected here, not evidence that no such case exists. (#1008)

## v10.248.0 — August 24, 2026 (A case that was listed as missing while it was there)

### Fixed

- **The Law Docket listed the right-to-food litigation under "What is deliberately not here" — while publishing two of its orders on the same page.** PUCL v. Union of India is the most consequential right-to-food case in India, and a reader scanning the docket was told it was absent. The note had been written when the docket held neither the mid-day meal order nor the ICDS order; both went in afterwards and the note stayed where it was. It now sits under coverage, where it says the true thing: two orders from a two-decade petition are here, and neither stands for the case as a whole. Nothing is currently listed as set aside. (#1005)

## v10.247.0 — August 24, 2026 (The mid-day meal order)

### For Learners

- **The mid-day meal order is now in the docket**, taking it to 61. The Supreme Court's direction of 28 November 2001 — every child in every government and government-assisted primary school to get a cooked meal of at least 300 calories and 8–12 grams of protein, for at least 200 school days — is the order that turned the mid-day meal from a scheme into an entitlement, and the reason a cooked meal rather than dry rations is the compliance standard. It is entered through the 2 May 2003 interim order that restates and enforces it, because that is the version whose full text is publicly available.

## v10.246.0 — August 24, 2026 (The right-to-food order, and a number that lied)

### For Learners

- **The right-to-food litigation is now represented in the docket**, taking it to 60. The 9 July 2007 order in PUCL v. Union of India directs that every sanctioned Anganwadi Centre actually be made operational and that ICDS reach children, adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women — the order to cite when a centre exists in the records and not in the village. It is described as what it is: one order in a petition that has run for two decades, not a summary of the whole case.

### Fixed

- **The docket said six cases had been set aside and listed one.** The sentence was written by hand while the list beneath it was generated from data, so when the list shrank the sentence did not. It now derives from the same data as the list and cannot contradict it. (#1002)

## v10.245.0 — August 24, 2026 (Five more judgments, and case names that read like case names)

### For Learners

- **Five judgments that were missing are now in the docket**, taking it to 59. NALSA on transgender recognition, Devika Biswas on sterilisation camps, the RTE 25% quota case, Sampurna Behura on juvenile justice machinery, and Consumer Education & Research Centre on asbestos workers' right to health. All five had been left out because an automated search could not resolve them; they were found by hand and checked against the judgment text like the rest.
- **Case names now read the way a lawyer would write them.** They had been carrying raw titles from the source database — "Vishaka & Ors vs State Of Rajasthan & Ors on 13 August, 1997" — which is machine output, not a case name. Every entry now reads "Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan", with the exact decision date beside it and the original title kept underneath so anyone can check the citation back to its source.
- **One case is still deliberately absent.** The right-to-food litigation, PUCL v. Union of India, runs as a continuing mandamus whose interim orders are not published as separate documents we could verify one at a time. Listing it as a single entry would misrepresent what it is, so the docket says why it is missing instead.

## v10.244.0 — August 24, 2026 (The judgments that changed development practice)

### For Learners

- **A new Development Law Docket** — 54 Indian Supreme Court judgments that changed what development organisations, state programmes and rights-holders can actually do. Each says what the court decided, what it changed on the ground, and whether it is still good law: Vishaka before there was a POSH Act, Olga Tellis on eviction and livelihood, Niyamgiri putting the decision with the Gram Sabha, Puttaswamy on privacy, Vikash Kumar on reasonable accommodation as a right rather than a concession. Searchable and filterable by theme, status and landmark.
- **The six law guides now cite cases.** Until now they explained what a law requires and never showed you the judgment that decided what it requires. POSH, RPwD, RTI, FCRA and child protection each gained the judgments that shaped them; the CSR guide says plainly that no landmark case turns on Section 135, because that absence is itself worth knowing.
- **Every entry says whether it still stands.** A holding can be narrowed later, replaced by a statute, or sent to a larger bench — seven of the 54 carry exactly that kind of qualification, and each explains it. Section 66A was struck down in 2015 and people are still booked under it; the docket says so.
- **What is missing is listed too.** Six candidate cases were dropped rather than published on a weak match, and the page names them and why. One search matched a different case with a similar name and was caught only by a second check.
- **An NFHS district explorer** joins the Dataverse — 93 indicators across 715 districts, comparing NFHS-5 and NFHS-6, by Nandlal Mishra. It is an independent project rather than an official release, so check figures against the NFHS factsheet before citing them.

## v10.243.0 — August 24, 2026 (Every Indian judgment, in one open dataset)

### For Learners

- **Open India Law is now in the Dataverse** — every Supreme Court and High Court judgment from 1950 to 2025 (12.8 million), 813,000 tribunal and regulator matters, and 22,265 Central and State Acts broken down to the individual section, all from official sources in one schema. The scrapers are open source and the compiled data is free to reuse with attribution. District and trial court decisions are not included.

## v10.242.0 — August 23, 2026 (Seven more open geospatial data sources)

### For Learners

- **Seven free sources for maps and satellite data have been added to the Dataverse**, now 335 entries. Natural Earth (public-domain basemaps you can publish without an attribution line), USGS EarthExplorer (the whole Landsat record back to 1972), Esri's Open Data Hub, OpenTopography (elevation and lidar, processed server-side so you request an area rather than download tiles), NASA Earth Observations (about fifty environmental variables as plain images and CSV grids — the easiest satellite source to teach with), UNEP's World Environment Situation Room, and Geofabrik's country-by-country OpenStreetMap extracts.
- **Two widely circulated GIS links were checked and left out.** UNEP's Environmental Data Explorer is offline, so the entry points at the World Environment Situation Room that replaced it. IPUMS Terra Populus has been decommissioned by its own maintainers — its page still loads, which is exactly why a link checker would not have caught it.

## v10.241.0 — August 23, 2026 (All 52 foundational decks now at full depth)

### For Learners

- **Every one of the 52 foundational 101 decks is now written to the same depth.** Forty-one of them were thin — around 70 words a slide, against 140-plus for the decks written later. Twenty-two were rewritten this week, finishing the set. Nothing that was already on a slide was changed; each slide gained the practical half a short deck leaves out — the failure modes, what a claim does not support, and what to check before you rely on it.
- **Survey Design 101** — 78 words a slide to 142. The added half is what separates a survey you can defend from one you cannot: why fixing a badly worded question breaks the trend it was measuring, why a beneficiary list is the most tempting sampling frame and the one that can never describe a population, which single component of survey error a margin of error actually describes (and which four it says nothing about), and why the cheapest completed interview is not cheap if it reaches the wrong people.
- **Data Visualization 101** — 81 words a slide to 142. The added half is how a chart misleads while every number in it is true: why a stacked bar can only be read reliably at the baseline segment, why overlapping confidence intervals mean the ranking you drew is not a ranking, why the rainbow colour ramp invents boundaries in smooth data, and why a map shaded by case counts is a map of where the people are.
- **Education & Pedagogy 101** — 77 words a slide to 147. The added half is the reasoning behind the methods: why guided discovery beats unguided for novices, what makes a real inquiry question different from a fake one, what ASER's household survey does and does not measure, why Teaching at the Right Level worked in trials and failed in some scale-ups, and why cascade training loses its content at every step down.
- **Safeguarding & PSEA 101** — every part now opens with a map of what it covers and the one thing in it that is hardest to get right: that assuming it cannot happen in your organisation is the condition under which it does, that the red lines are short and the difficulty lives in everyday boundaries, and that well-meaning amateur investigation is the failure that recurs.
- **Impact Evaluation 101, Theory of Change 101, Logframe 101, Political Economy 101, Research Ethics 101, Feminist Research 101, Data Feminism 101, Gender Mainstreaming 101, Women's Economic Empowerment 101, Care Economy 101, Community Development 101, Behaviour Change Communication 101, Indian Constitution 101, Global Development Governance 101, Visual Ethnography 101, Exploratory Data Analysis 101, Item Response Theory 101 and English for Development 101** have each been rewritten to roughly twice their previous depth.

## v10.240.0 — August 22, 2026 (Four more foundational decks at full depth)

### For Learners

- **Observation to Insight 101 has been rewritten** — 72 words a slide to 155. The added half is what makes watching a method rather than a visit: why not seeing something in twelve sessions is not evidence it does not happen, why "the mother was hostile" is a judgement no reader can check and "she folded her arms and did not reply" is a record they can, why notes written three days later feel vivid and have quietly reorganised themselves around your conclusion, and why the rule that competent staff keep breaking is usually the finding.
- **Fundraising Basics 101 has been rewritten** — 72 words a slide to 154. The added half is the part that decides whether you are eligible rather than merely unsuccessful: that CSR is a statutory duty restricted to a defined list and so can never fund your organisation, that CSR-1 and 80G are gates and not paperwork, why committing co-funding you have not yet raised turns a win into a deadline, and that a company which under-spent its obligation last year is the most receptive prospect you will find.
- **Public Health 101 has been rewritten** — 72 words a slide to 148.

### Fixed

- **Two diagrams in Observation to Insight 101 were cut off at the bottom of the slide**, taking their explanations with them. The triangulation triangle lost the line naming the four kinds of triangulation the rest of the section depends on, and the funnel lost the sentence saying what the narrowing means — leaving four coloured bands and no explanation. Both had been that way since the deck was published. (#998)

## v10.239.0 — August 22, 2026 (Everything we have ever fixed, on one page)

### For Learners

- **The Known Issues page now lists everything we have fixed, not just the last 90 days.** It showed nothing when you first looked, and it was right to: it reads live from our issue tracker, and we had filed three bug reports in the site's entire history while quietly fixing ninety-two things and writing them up in these release notes. The fixes were real; the record was not searchable. Every one of those ninety-two is now on the page, dated by the release it shipped in — because that is the date we actually know. (#993)
- **Public Health 101 has been rewritten** — 72 words a slide to 148. The added half is the reasoning that makes the subject usable: why a rise in prevalence can mean treatment is working rather than an epidemic worsening, why most cases come from the many at modest risk rather than the few at high risk (so advice reaches the wrong people and regulation reaches everyone), that newborn deaths are now most of India's infant mortality, and why a scheme covering hospital bills leaves untouched the outpatient spending that is most of what families actually pay.
- **Multivariate Analysis 101 has been rewritten** — 71 words a slide to 154. The added half is the judgement a coefficient cannot supply: which variables belong in a model and which two kinds make it worse, why dropping an overlapping predictor swaps a visible problem for an invisible one, and why an odds ratio of 2 does not mean twice as likely.
- **Econometrics 101 has been rewritten** — 71 words a slide to 151. The added half is how to read someone else's causal claim: find the design, find the single assumption it rests on, and ask what would break it.
- **Advocacy Basics 101, Sexual Health (SRHR) 101, Cost Effectiveness 101, Qualitative Methods 101, Maternal Health 101 and Mixed Methods 101** have each been rewritten to roughly twice their previous depth.

### Fixed

- **Maternal Health 101 gave the wrong figure for anaemia in pregnancy.** Two stat cards said 57% of pregnant women in India are anaemic, citing NFHS-5. That is the figure for all women aged 15–49; for pregnant women NFHS-5 reports 52%. Both cards now say 52%, and the table beside them gives all three figures so the distinction is visible rather than something you have to already know. (#993)
- **The Known Issues page had no way to show anything fixed before we started filing issues** (#993), so it showed an empty list — which reads as "nothing is broken" and was the one thing that page must never say falsely.

## v10.238.0 — August 22, 2026 (A diagram in every flagship module)

### For Learners

- **There is now a public list of everything we know is broken.** [Known Issues](https://www.impactmojo.in/known-issues.html) shows every open bug and everything fixed in the last 90 days, read live from our issue tracker rather than typed up by hand — so it cannot quietly fall behind what we are actually working on. It also says plainly what belongs there and what does not: outages are on System Status, feature requests are on the roadmap, and security reports should come to us privately rather than as a public issue. If you have found something broken, there is a form on the page for people who do not use GitHub.
- **Decolonising Development 101 has been rewritten** — 70 words a slide to 151. The added half is the part that makes the argument usable rather than decorative: seven audit questions with documentary answers, why overhead caps are the most concrete test of a "partnership", and — throughout — Ambedkar's objection to the romanticised village, because a critique that cannot name caste inside the formerly colonised society has chosen the comfortable half of the argument.
- **Child Development 101 has been rewritten** — 70 words a slide to 159. The added half is what a programme actually has to decide: why stunting and wasting need different programmes and are constantly conflated, why the first 1,000 days start at conception and most services start years later, why "families lead" is a claim about policy rather than a way of moving responsibility onto mothers, and why screening children for developmental difficulty where no referral service exists is a harm rather than a neutral act.
- **Bivariate Analysis 101 has been rewritten** — 69 words a slide to 152. The added half is what separates an analysis that survives review from one that is quietly withdrawn: why "no evidence of a difference" is not "no difference", why five groups means ten comparisons and a 40% chance of a false positive, why wealth is the confounder behind nearly every relationship in development data, and why the causal claim usually enters a report through the chart title rather than the analysis.
- **Data Literacy 101 has been rewritten** — 69 words a slide to 163. The additions are the things that go wrong in real reports: why a 99%-accurate test for a rare condition mostly produces false positives, why a state survey estimate cannot describe your block however badly you need the number, why the district "league tables" in this sector are largely ranking noise, and why targeting the worst-performing blocks guarantees that a before-and-after comparison overstates what you did.
- **Digital Ethics 101 has been rewritten** — 68 words a slide to 169. The additions are the operational half: why wrongful exclusion is invisible in the same data that makes wrongful inclusion a scandal, why dropping the caste column does not remove caste from a model, what makes a manual fallback work rather than exist on paper, and the procurement questions to put in a contract rather than ask in a meeting.
- **Post-Truth Politics 101 has been rewritten too** — 68 words a slide to 174. The added half is the part that makes the deck usable rather than interesting: why the most-cited study in the field says less than it is quoted as saying, why cheapfakes do more damage than deepfakes and get a fraction of the attention, why fact-checking a firehose feeds it, and what a rumour costs a vaccination programme in this region, measured in staff safety rather than engagement.
- **SEL Basics 101 has been rewritten to nearly three times its depth** — from 67 words a slide to 184, the first of the 41 foundational decks being brought up to the new standard. The added material is the practical half a thin deck leaves out: what each competency looks like in an eight-year-old, the four objections you will actually hear in a staffroom and what to say back, why the most-quoted number in the field ("11-percentile-point gain") is misquoted as often as it is cited, and where SEL turns into asking children to cope with conditions the school should be fixing.

- **Every one of the 259 flagship modules now carries a hand-drawn diagram.** The last 58 were added this week, finishing a set that started at 12 courses out of 20: the two routes a rupee can take from cotton to cloth, the four conditions Gandhi held had to be in place before a fast was anything other than coercion, and the ring diagram that explains why he thought a village worker who had never spun had no standing to speak for the village.
- **Power BI's diagram captions were rendering as ordinary paragraphs.** It was the one flagship whose page had never styled them, so eight captions sat at body size, upright, reading as another line of text rather than as a note under the figure.
- **A Power BI resource card linked to a folder with no page in it**, so "Open the handout" reached a 404. It now opens the Data & Technology track in the handouts browser, where those templates actually live.

### Fixed

- **Three 101 decks had a five-across row of stat cards rendering as five stacked full-width boxes** — MEL Basics, Mixed Methods and Community Development each used a `c5` grid class that was never defined, so the row collapsed to one column and pushed the closing note to the bottom edge of the slide.
- Twenty-one course pages — every lexicon, plus the Power BI course itself — were never having their CSS and JavaScript links content-stamped, because the check only looked at files named `index.html`. Those pages could pair fresh markup with a previous deploy's stylesheet on the first load after a release. The check now walks the whole course tree.

## v10.237.0 — August 21, 2026 (Every flagship now teaches the same way)

### For Learners

- **Every module of every flagship course now ends with a question about your own work.** All 259 modules across the 20 flagships gained a closing reflection prompt, a worked example and a source extract — where before, reflection prompts existed in only 3 courses and worked examples in 4. The worked examples are concrete: two venue quotes where the cheaper one cannot be made accessible at any price, two completion figures from the same quarter that differ only in what was counted, four women with identical disability certificates and four different outcomes.
- **Every course now has a capstone plan and diagrams.** Capstone timelines went from 7 courses to all 20, and diagrams from 12 to all 20 — including the disability–poverty cycle, the twin-track approach, and why a map coloured by case counts is really a population map.
- **Nothing About Us Without Us has been rebuilt.** It was the thinnest course on the site and the only one with no source extracts at all. It now runs at more than double the depth, quoting the Disability Rights Convention directly — including the article that says a disabled adult's decisions are theirs to make, which is the one most often quietly ignored in practice. Its lexicon grew to 41 terms.
- **Sixteen data explorers now work properly with our analytics**, so we can finally tell which of them people actually use — ASER, NFHS, UDISE, PLFS, AISHE and eleven others had no tracking at all.

### Fixed

- **Eleven flagship courses were showing coloured callout boxes with no colour.** The highlighted boxes meant to draw your eye to a key point were rendering as ordinary paragraphs, and had been for some time. On the Constitutional Law course the reflection prompts had lost their border entirely. All 20 courses now share one stylesheet, and a new automated check makes this class of fault impossible to ship again.
- **The green "Worked example" heading was too faint to read comfortably** against its panel, in both light and dark mode. It now meets the contrast standard.
- **Public Choice offered "Course Papers" and "AI Study Companion" links that opened an email window.** They looked live and were not. They now say clearly that they are coming, as three other courses already did.

## v10.236.0 — August 21, 2026 (The coach speaks once per module, and it is not always the same coach)

### For Learners

- **Every flagship module now ends with one note from a coach, and the two coaches alternate.** You will hear from Vandana, then Varna, then Vandana, the whole way down a course. Before this, some courses repeated the same invitation three or four times inside a single module — the SEL course had 52 of them across 13 modules — and others put the same face on module after module. 158 repeats are gone across all 20 flagships, and the notes that remain say something specific about the module you have just read.
- **Public Choice callouts now have a coaching link.** All 13 named a coach and showed a generic quote icon with nothing to click. They now carry the coach's photo and the booking link, with the original notes kept as written.

### Changed

- The flagship course standard now states the rule plainly: one reflection prompt and one coach callout per module, coaches alternating so no two consecutive modules show the same face. "Alternating" had been ambiguous and was read as "occasionally".

## v10.235.0 — August 21, 2026 (A new flagship: Sustainability, ESG & Corporate Responsibility)

### For Learners

- **Sustainability, ESG & Corporate Responsibility for Development Practice** — our 20th free flagship course. India made corporate social spending a legal duty in 2013, and about ₹40,000 crore a year now moves through it. This course is about the part the law leaves open: how to design a portfolio for a real district instead of a theme, how to negotiate an agreement that survives the March deadline, how to build measurement a finance director will sign, how to read a company's supply chain for the harm it causes rather than the good it funds, and how to read a BRSR properly. 13 modules, self-paced, no login.
- **ESG & CSR Lexicon** — 63 terms with plain definitions and a worked example each, from Section 135 and Schedule VII to scope 3 emissions, the contract worker ratio and double materiality. Search it or filter by category.
- **A capstone worth doing.** The final module asks for a three-year strategy for a company and district you choose — including the recommendation the company will not enjoy reading. Everything you need is published; the course shows you where.

### Fixed

- **Thirteen pages were loading with no main heading**, including eleven course lexicons and the Theory of Change Lab. The title was in the page but was being stripped as the page finished loading, so screen readers had nothing to announce. All are back.

## v10.234.0 — August 21, 2026 (A guide for instructors, and numbers that finally add up)

### For Learners

- **A new guide for anyone teaching with our material.** [Teaching, LMS Export & Gradebook](teaching-and-lms-guide.md) explains which package format your university's system wants, what is stripped out of a course before it goes into your LMS and why, how to collect Studio work with a student's name attached, and how to turn a folder of submissions into one gradebook file.
- **The 101 Course Decks guide has been rewritten.** It was describing decks hosted on an external service we stopped using. It now lists all 52 decks by track, with what each slug is, how to link to a specific slide from a syllabus, and how to put a deck in your LMS.

### Fixed

- **The site was telling you there were 51 foundational courses. There are 52.** The wrong number was on the homepage, the catalogue, the FAQ, the premium and teaching pages, and the 101 series landing page itself — including its browser tab and its main heading. The homepage went further and offered "71 courses (19 flagship + 51 foundational)", which does not add up.
- **The About page's numbers were behind on six counts** (courses, reading companions, handouts, studios, deep dives and data explorers), and the upgrade page's banner was showing 9 flagship courses and 16 games where there are 19 and 135.
- **The check that is supposed to catch exactly this had three holes in it**, which is why none of the above was noticed. All three are closed, and the repaired check immediately found eleven more stale numbers across the site.

## v10.233.0 — August 21, 2026 (Marking Studio work just got easier)

### For Learners

- **Submit Studio work with your name on it.** In the LogFrame Builder Studio there is now a *Submit for marking* button: type your name once and you get a file to send your instructor, containing your actual work. More Studios will follow.
- **Instructors: a gradebook CSV in one step.** Drop the files your students sent you into the new gradebook page and download a single CSV your Moodle or Canvas gradebook can import. It runs entirely in your browser — student work is never uploaded anywhere, including to us.

## v10.232.0 — August 21, 2026 (Your course, inside your university's LMS)

### For Learners

- **Put any ImpactMojo course into Moodle, Canvas or Blackboard.** A new page builds a SCORM package, a Common Cartridge, or a single self-contained file for any of our 71 courses and 47 practice workbooks — pick one, pick a format, download. Free, no login. Once imported it runs without internet, and SCORM tells your gradebook who finished. Google Classroom can use the single-file version.

## v10.232.0 — August 21, 2026 (CSR & ESG 101)

### For Learners

- **CSR & ESG 101** — a new free course on corporate responsibility in India. Starts where the law does: who Section 135 of the Companies Act binds, what Schedule VII allows you to spend on, how the two per cent is actually calculated, and where unspent money has to go. Then SEBI's BRSR and the global frameworks, and a checklist for reading any company's sustainability report and spotting what it leaves out. 88 slides, self-paced, no login.

## v10.231.0 — August 21, 2026 (Search and buttons that were quietly missing)

### Fixed

- **The Gandhian Lexicon's search box and category filter are back.** They were in the page markup but were being removed as the page finished loading, so the lexicon opened with no way to search or filter its 55 terms. The same fault had removed the **LogFrame Builder Studio**'s Import, Example and Reset buttons, and the **Public Choice lexicon**'s count of visible terms.
- **Twenty-four pages were loading with no main heading**, including Events, Build Circles, the Game Library, The Long View and the assessed-certificate pages. The title was written into each page but stripped before it rendered — so the page looked untitled, and screen readers had nothing to announce.

## v10.230.0 — August 21, 2026 (Instructor kits go back to being personal)

### Changed

- **The instructor kit is mapped to your syllabus again.** A general kit page went up earlier today and has been taken down — it was a weaker substitute for what the page actually offers, which is a kit built around the course *you* teach. Requesting one works the same way, and now sends you an acknowledgement with a five-working-day commitment.

## v10.229.0 — August 21, 2026 (The fifty-rupee fine, revisited)

### For Learners

- **Animal Welfare Law and the Fifty-Rupee Fine** now carries a section on Animal Ask's 2026 prioritisation of Indian animal advocacy — which reaches the same conclusion about enforcement from a different direction, names the specific legal mechanisms (making offences cognizable, SPCA penalty powers), sets the scale against which court cases are a small lever, and reports that how an ask is framed decides whether it travels.

## v10.228.0 — August 21, 2026 (An instructor kit, and a form that answers you)

### For Learners

- **Instructor Kit** — a ready-made 14-week monitoring-and-evaluation teaching plan, mapped week by week to material you can open today: the MEL flagship, the 101 decks, the studios whose exports work as gradeable assignments, and the case challenges. It says plainly which parts are free, which are part-free, and what the paid extras cost. Free to use in any classroom under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

### Changed

- **Requesting an instructor kit now asks the right questions and answers you back.** The form asks what your course is called, at what level, and what it covers — the things needed to actually map a kit — and you get an immediate acknowledgement with a five-working-day commitment instead of silence.

## v10.227.0 — August 21, 2026 (Four new Data Notes, and flow charts)

### For Learners

- **Almost all of India's export growth came from services** — India's total exports rose $42.80 billion in 2024-25. Merchandise contributed $0.35 billion of it. A look at which half of the economy actually sells to the world.
- **Most of what India borrows pays for what it already borrowed** — the 2026-27 Budget borrows ₹16.96 lakh crore and pays ₹14.04 lakh crore in interest. Also: why the famous budget-rupee pie and the budget table don't use the same rupee.
- **Announced, unspent, announced again** — ₹2.04 lakh crore of scheme money was budgeted in 2025-26 and revised away. Four flagship schemes lost 70–85% of their allocation, then got roughly the same number again.
- **The states' 41% share comes to 35% of the tax** — the Finance Commission's 41% is a share of the divisible pool, not of what the Centre collects. Three true numbers, three denominators.

### Added

- **Flow diagrams in Data Notes.** The chart engine now draws Sankeys, so a Data Note can show a quantity that splits, merges or gets absorbed — a trade deficit offset by a services surplus, a budget rupee from its sources to its uses, a tax pool divided between Centre and states.

## v10.226.0 — August 21, 2026 (Correction to the partnerships page)

### Fixed

- **The partnerships page said things about our partners that were never true.** As first published it claimed Populi reviews our courses and toolkits before release, supplies us anonymised evaluation cases, and receives referrals from us; and that India Institute reviews our governance and policy content. It also set out a five-point partnership policy and a menu of six partnership services. None of that had been agreed with anyone — it was written to fill out the page. All of it is removed, and replaced with what the arrangements actually are: ImpactMojo does capacity building work for both partners, refers and endorses Populi for full-fledged research projects, and endorses India Institute for measurement work — measurements, tools and validation. Each partner's own description of itself is quoted and attributed to their site.

## v10.225.0 — August 21, 2026 (A partnerships page)

### Added

- **Partnerships page** (`/partnerships.html`) — lists ImpactMojo's partners: Populi (end-to-end research and MEL advisory), India Institute (thought advocacy and measurement) and PinPoint Ventures (sponsor). Each partner's own description of itself is quoted and attributed to their site. Carries an enquiry form (reuses the existing `partner-inquiry` form, so enquiries land alongside the ones from About). Not linked in the site navigation.

## v10.224.0 — August 20, 2026 (New post: designing an impact evaluation)

### For Learners

- **Designing an Impact Evaluation: Eight Steps, and When to Take Them** — the standard guidance lists eight steps in order, but the counterfactual constrains every step before it, and teams that reach it last find their options already gone. Covers randomised phase-in, eligibility thresholds, and what to ask when the programme is a universal entitlement like MGNREGA.
## v10.223.0 — August 20, 2026 (Course progress counts partial work)

### For Learners

- **Your progress bar moves as you go.** It used to sit at zero until you got every question in a module right; now each correct answer counts, and both the bar and your account page show it.
- **A module no longer needs a perfect score.** Getting the majority right — 3 of 4 — completes it.
## v10.222.0 — August 20, 2026 (Site search can find the paid resources)

### For Learners

- **Searching the site now finds the practice resources.** The assessment banks, checklists, templates, workbooks, refreshers and posters were live and linked, but typing "logframe" or "field readiness" into site search returned nothing. All 33 are now findable.

## v10.221.0 — August 20, 2026 (Nine ways to fail silently, closed)

### Fixed

- Saving your notification preferences said "Saved" even when it hadn't been. That, and eight other places where the site could fail to save something without telling you or anyone else, now report the failure.

## v10.219.0 — August 19, 2026 (The wiki stopped quoting numbers nobody checked)

### Fixed

- The project wiki was still advertising 163 reading companions, 34 labs, 22 deep dives and 89 handouts. The real figures are 166, 35, 23 and 90, and the wiki is now held to the same canonical count file as the website.

## v10.218.0 — August 19, 2026 (Two pages stopped answering to the same name)

### For Learners

- **The Theory of Change lab is called the same thing everywhere now.** Clicking "Theory of Change Studio" in the catalogue used to land you on a page headed "Theory of Change Workbench" — which is also the name of a different page on the site. The lab is the Studio; the Workbench is the Workbench.
- **Site search no longer returns the same lab twice.**

## v10.217.0 — August 19, 2026 (An eighth Fundamentals map: the social model of disability)

### For Learners

- **The Social Model of Disability** — the eighth framework, and the completion of the three added this week. Six Indian outcomes drawn as barrier stacks: what stands between a person and a public building, a bus, finishing school, a job, being counted at all, and the certificate that unlocks the rest. Each band's width is how much of the way that barrier blocks; click one for the evidence behind it.

  The pair the page opens on: **43.6% of persons with disability entered a public building in a year, and 63.9% of those who did found it difficult.** Read one way those figures describe a population; read the other they describe a set of buildings.

  The page is explicit about what the model does not claim, and about Anita Ghai's argument that a model built against a functioning welfare state travels imperfectly to a context where services are thin for everyone.

## v10.216.0 — August 19, 2026 (A seventh Fundamentals map: sustainable livelihoods)

### For Learners

- **The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework** — the seventh framework in the series. Eight Indian livelihoods drawn as asset pentagons across the five capitals, and shown together so the shapes can be compared: a landless labourer's collapses on the natural axis, a large landholder's is nearly full, a home-based worker's is the smallest on the page. Open any one for the shocks and trends it sits inside, the structures that decide what its assets are actually worth, and the evidence for every corner.

  The finding the page is built around: an average Indian agricultural household earns **₹4,063 a month from wages and ₹3,058 from crop production**. The households that farming defines earn more from selling their labour than from farming.

## v10.215.0 — August 19, 2026 (A sixth Fundamentals map: gender needs)

### For Learners

- **Practical and Strategic Gender Needs** — the sixth framework in the Fundamentals series, and the first built around gender analysis. Caroline Moser's distinction between what makes a woman's day lighter and what changes whose day it is, drawn as a plot: twelve Indian interventions placed by how much burden each actually lifts and how far it moves the division of labour, assets or authority. Ujjwala, Jal Jeevan and household toilets sit in one corner; the 73rd Amendment's reserved seats and daughters' coparcenary rights in another; MGNREGA and childcare in the corner where both move at once. Every position opens onto its evidence, and says what it leaves unsettled.

## v10.214.0 — August 19, 2026 (Readable in both themes, and tappable on a phone)

### For Learners

- **Blog posts open on a phone again.** An invisible full-screen panel was sitting over the blog page on mobile and catching every tap, so no post could be opened. It was never visible and nothing errored.
- **Text is readable in dark mode.** Around 1,900 places across the site put text on a background that was too faint to read comfortably in one theme or the other — buttons with white labels on pale backgrounds, muted captions on grey panels, the language chips on the testimonials page. All corrected in both themes.
- **The Capability Approach diagram fits a phone screen.** The conversion chain was running its labels off the edge on narrow screens. It now stacks properly, with the three conversion factors as a legend along the foot.
- **The Fundamentals page said "Four so far" while listing five.** Fixed, and the page now says what it actually holds.

## v10.213.0 — August 19, 2026 (A long read on animal welfare law)

### For Learners

- **Animal Welfare Law and the Fifty-Rupee Fine** — a new blog post on the distance between India's animal welfare law and the cost of breaking it. The maximum fine for a first offence of cruelty has been ₹50 since 1960; in real terms it is now ₹3.79. Four charts, including the finding that slaughter restrictions appear to have made welfare worse across the herd.

## v10.212.0 — August 19, 2026 (The capability chain, drawn)

### For Learners

- **The Capability Approach now has a real diagram** — the conversion chain drawn out, showing the three kinds of conversion factor feeding into it and what leaks away between what is provided and what a person can actually do.

## v10.211.0 — August 19, 2026 (A different way into the Wheel of Power)

### For Learners

- **Twelve questions instead of marking yourself** — the Wheel of Power can now work out where you sit from questions about categories, and show you the definition behind each placement so you can disagree with it. Every question is skippable, and your answers never leave your browser.

## v10.210.0 — August 19, 2026 (Challenges now take attachments)

### For Learners

- **Attach your work to a Live Case Challenge** — upload a PDF, Word, Excel or PowerPoint file, or an image, alongside your written response.
- **Your submission now tells you if it did not go through.** Previously a failed submission still showed a confirmation. If something goes wrong you will see it, and your text is kept in the browser so nothing is lost.

## v10.210.0 — August 19, 2026 (A fifth Fundamentals map)

### For Learners

- **The Capability Approach** — a new Fundamentals page on the difference between what a programme provides and what a person can actually do with it. Five Indian examples followed end to end, from school places against reading levels to toilets built against toilets used.

## v10.209.0 — August 19, 2026 (Two new reading companions)

### For Learners

- **The Science and Application of Positive Psychology** — a companion to the Cheavens and Feldman textbook, including its chapter on how to tell the research from the pop psychology that uses the same words.
- **Unlimited Memory** — a companion to Kevin Horsley's memory-technique book: the SEE principle, journeys and pegs, and the review habit the methods depend on.

## v10.208.0 — August 19, 2026 (A new reading companion)

### For Learners

- **Public Health, Ethics, and Equity** — a new interactive reading companion to the Anand, Peter and Sen volume on what makes a health inequality unjust. Covers the social gradient, the ethics built into measures like the DALY, and why Kerala reports both India's longest lives and its most self-reported illness.

## v10.207.0 — August 19, 2026 (New on the blog)

### For Learners

- **The p-value answers a question you probably aren't asking** — a new post on why a p-value and a confidence interval tell you different things, and why the interval is usually the one that should decide what you do next. Includes a worked example where the same result supports opposite decisions.

## v10.206.0 — August 19, 2026 (A new Deep Dive)

### For Learners

- **Farm Animal Welfare in India** — a new Deep Dive. Fourteen readings on India's livestock numbers, the 1960 cruelty law and its fifty-rupee fine, the Supreme Court judgment that extended the right to life to animals, the cage-free rules drafted in 2017 and never brought into force, and the research showing how cattle protection laws affect the herd.

## v10.205.0 — August 19, 2026 (Wheel labels, library counts, and a backend fix)

### Fixed

- Labels on the wheel's outer ring were running into the dividing lines between segments. They now sit clear of them.
- The Libraries page was showing out-of-date totals for reading companions, handouts and the Dataverse, and its Fundamentals card still described only the wheel rather than all four maps.

## v10.204.0 — August 19, 2026 (Fundamentals: rendering and contrast fixes)

### Fixed

- The Fundamentals diagrams could come up blank on the first visit after a release — the page's markup arrived fresh while its cached code was a version behind. Asset URLs now change whenever the file does, so the two can no longer fall out of step.
- Labels on the outer ring of the Wheel were white on a pale background and hard to read. They are now dark.
- The Power Cube's three axis titles were unreadable in dark mode. They now have a colour per theme.

## v10.202.0 — August 19, 2026 (Fundamentals: the wheel of power, with the evidence)

### For Learners

- **Fundamentals — an interactive Indian Wheel of Power & Powerlessness.** Twelve axes, three bands on each, thirty-six positions a person can occupy. Open any band to see the Indian evidence behind where it sits: 113 sourced statistics, statutes and judgments from NFHS-5, PLFS 2023–24, Census 2011, the NSS 76th Round, NCRB, AISHE, ASER, the Time Use Survey, the National MPI and the World Inequality Lab, each with its publication and year. Every axis also says what the evidence leaves unsettled, and the page is direct about where India has no data at all: sexual orientation is uncounted, disability is measured at 2.2% against a global estimate nearer 16%, and no official survey collects anything on skin tone or appearance. You can mark where you sit on each axis privately; nothing is scored or totalled. The wheel itself is by **The Listeners Collective** in Bengaluru, adapting Sylvia Duckworth's Wheel of Power/Privilege, and the page credits them and the lineage behind them in full.

## v10.201.0 — August 16, 2026 (Statistical illusions in the gallery)

### For Learners

- **unspurious — a compendium of statistical illusions** — a new card in The Long View's gallery, pointing to twenty-eight ways that perfectly correct arithmetic can walk you to the wrong answer, each with a figure you can poke. Filter for it under the new "How Numbers Mislead" chip.

## v10.199.0 — August 16, 2026 (Telugu documentation)

### For Learners

- **The documentation is now in Telugu** — all 54 guides, matching what already existed in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi and Tamil. Telugu readers had the site in their language but not the docs behind it; that gap is closed. Two missing Telugu course dictionaries (Public Policy, SEL) are filled in too, so Telugu now has the same 33 page translations as every other language.

## v10.198.0 — August 16, 2026 (Marginalia essay 6)

### For Learners

- **The Proposal Wrote the Programme** — the sixth Marginalia cartoon essay, ten drawings on the gap between the proposal and the programme: community-led on paper, demand-driven until the donor's priorities arrive, the innovation angle nobody asked for, the consortium that meets more than it delivers, and a sustainability plan written to be filed rather than followed. Each cartoon is footnoted with the evidence behind it.

## v10.191.0 — August 15, 2026 (Four new chart forms in The Long View)

### For Learners

- **Where the rupee comes from, and where it goes.** The Union Budget 2025–26 drawn as a single rupee: eight receipts narrow into it on the left, nine spending heads fan out on the right, every band sized in paise. Nearly a quarter of what the government spends is borrowed — and 20 paise of every rupee goes straight back out as interest on past borrowing. The largest single spending head isn't a scheme at all: it's the states' constitutional share of taxes.
- **Where India's poor actually live.** A dot-density map, one dot for every 10 lakh people in multidimensional poverty, scattered at random inside each state. Bihar has the highest poverty *rate*; Uttar Pradesh has the largest *number* of poor people — about 5.4 crore, more than the population of South Korea. Put it beside the rate map already in the studio and you can see exactly how differently rates and counts rank the same country.
- **One person, one vote?** A Dorling cartogram — every state a circle sized by its people, the coastline thrown away — coloured by how many people each Lok Sabha MP represents. Seats were frozen at the 1971 census, so a Rajasthan MP speaks for 27.4 lakh people and a Kerala MP for 16.7 lakh. The darkest circles are northern, the palest southern; that pattern is the delimitation debate in one picture.
- **India, one hexagon at a time.** A tilegram: give every crore of Indians one hexagon and the country's real weight appears in 121 tiles, of which Uttar Pradesh alone claims 20. Unlike a tile map that gives each state one tile, here the map itself becomes a bar chart you can count by eye. Zones are colour-coded, and the North, Central and East together hold about three in four hexagons.
- Each chart opens onto its own page with the takeaway, the source, *why this chart form*, *how it was built* and *what to look for* — and the four map forms are meant to be read in sequence as a short course in what a map decides to encode.

## v10.190.0 — August 14, 2026 (Skills Profiler, MEL Rosetta Lab & Key Terms handout)

### For Learners

- **Skills Profiler — a free 20-minute check-up for development practitioners.** Where are you strong, and what should you learn next? Forty questions across **MEL, Data & Technology, Policy & Economics and AI for M&E**, drawn from ImpactMojo's 2,000-question assessment banks. You get a domain-by-domain profile with strengths and growth areas, an explanation for every answer, matched free next steps, and an attempt history that stays on your own device. No login, no payment — and no fake percentiles: it's a formative mirror, not a gate, and the methodology is published in full on the page.
- **MEL Rosetta Lab — translate between the frameworks.** The same MEL words mean different things across donors: *outcome* in FCDO usage is *purpose* in a classic USAID logframe and *specific objective* in EU usage. Pick any of 20 contested terms and see what every system means by it, walk the crosswalks for indicator tests (SMART vs CREAM vs SPICED), evaluation criteria, causal approaches, gender instruments and evidence standards — and read the four places the frameworks genuinely conflict, kept deliberately untranslated. Every definition from a named primary source.
- **Key Terms in MEL: A Disambiguation Handout** — the print-friendly companion (the 90th handout). Attribution vs contribution, impact vs reach, effectiveness vs efficiency vs efficacy, indicator vs target vs milestone — each entry states the confusion, quotes the competing definitions with sources (OECD-DAC Glossary 2nd edition, 2023 throughout), gives a practical test, and names what breaks if you get it wrong. Ends with the donor logframe dialect table and a pin-up quick reference.

### Added

- The Interactive Studios grow to **35 labs**; handouts to **90**. The profiler cross-links the free courses per domain and the paid Assessed Tracks for those who want the credential.

## v10.189.0 — August 14, 2026 (HPI Explorer & three Dataverse additions)

### For Learners

- **HPI Explorer — how much life does a country get per unit of planet?** The Data Room's twelfth explorer, and its first global one, opens up the **Happy Planet Index** — life expectancy × life satisfaction ÷ ecological footprint, for **157 countries across two decades (2006–2025)**, with South Asia as its own region. Rank the world in any year (Costa Rica leads at 68.3; Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan all beat India), track any country against the world median and the planet's shrinking fair share (1.71 → 1.48 global hectares per person), and put two countries head-to-head ingredient by ingredient. Don't miss the India puzzle: **#11 in the world in 2006, #65 in 2025** — life expectancy up seven years, footprint still tiny, but reported life satisfaction in a two-decade slide. Every figure is from the published HPI 2026 data file, cited as its authors request.

### Added

- **Three new Dataverse sources** (Economic wellbeing & environment): the **Happy Planet Index** public dataset (Hot or Cool Institute), **Global Footprint Network Open Data** (ecological footprint & biocapacity accounts, 1961–present), and **World Happiness Report Data** (Gallup life-evaluation scores). The Dataverse now catalogues **328** resources.
- **The Data Room grows to twelve explorers** — `hpi.html` joins as a new "Wellbeing & the planet" group on `explorers.html`, with cards on the homepage strip and in the catalog.

## v10.188.0 — August 12, 2026 (LEAP Cities Explorer & Dataverse addition)

### For Learners

- **LEAP Cities Explorer — the city economies official statistics can't see.** India estimates no GDP below the state level, so nobody officially knows how big Mangaluru's or Kolhapur's economy is. The new explorer opens up the LEAP Cities Index 2026 — economist Megha Patnaik's composite score for **233 Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities** across eight sectors of economic life. Rank cities by any pillar (a mid-table city can lead manufacturing outright), put any two cities head-to-head across all eight pillars, see which states' smaller cities score highest, or search the full sortable table. The eleventh room in The Data Room — every figure is the published score, source-linked and openly licensed.

### Added

- **LEAP Cities Index 2026** added to the Dataverse (Economic & Financial category) — composite economic scores for 233 Tier-2/Tier-3 Indian cities from 43 official and administrative variables, organised into eight GVA-aligned pillars, by the India Productivity Lab (Patnaik, 2026; Zenodo, CC BY 4.0). The Dataverse now catalogues **325** resources.
- **The Data Room grows to eleven explorers** — `cities.html` joins as a new "city economy" group on `explorers.html`, with cards on the homepage strip and in the catalog.

## v10.187.0 — August 5, 2026 (Docs, translations & MCP count consistency)

### Fixed

- **Content counts are now consistent on the docs and repo side too.** The self-hosted documentation — including the Hindi, Marathi, Tamil and Bengali translations — showed older figures (53 courses, 13/17 flagship, 40 foundational, 13 labs, 85 handouts, 270 data tools). All now match canonical (**70 courses · 19 flagship · 51 foundational · 34 labs · 89 handouts · 324 Dataverse**). The MCP server's tool descriptions and README were also updated to 324 Dataverse resources. Contextual and historical numbers (per-module counts, changelog/roadmap entries) were deliberately left as-is.

## v10.186.0 — August 5, 2026 (Sitewide content-count consistency)

### Fixed

- **Content counts are now consistent across the whole site.** Several pages still showed older totals (the Dataverse catalogue at 321/296/270, labs at 30/35/36, courses at 69, flagship courses at 17/18, reading companions at 105) — the correct figures are **324 Dataverse resources, 34 labs, 70 courses, 19 flagship courses, 163 reading companions**. Every landing, pricing, press-kit and sitemap page, plus the overview docs, now agree. Behind the scenes the count-drift guard was rebuilt to scan every user-facing page automatically (not a hand-maintained list) and to track the Dataverse total, so this class of drift is caught in CI from now on.

## v10.185.0 — August 5, 2026 (PLFS Workforce Explorer: pay, job security & confidence intervals)

### For Learners

- **PLFS Workforce Explorer — three new lenses.** The labour explorer now goes past "how many work" to *what kind* of work. **Compare pay** shows what women and men earn across the three kinds of work (regular, self-employed, casual) — the gap is starkest in self-employment, where women earn about a third of what men do. **See job security** reveals that nearly three in five workers are self-employed and most regular employees have no written contract, no paid leave and no social-security benefit. And the state **rankings now carry 95% confidence-interval whiskers**, so you can see where a gap between two states is real and where it's just sampling noise. Every figure is transcribed from the PLFS 2023-24 Annual Report (Statements 6–12 and the Appendix B standard-error tables), with the quarterly-earnings basis and the interval caveats disclosed in plain language.

## v10.184.0 — August 5, 2026 (Dataverse: India Labour Observatory)

### Added

- **India Labour Observatory** added to the Dataverse (India Government Data category) — an independent interactive atlas of India's labour market built on PLFS 2023-24, with state/UT views of participation, unemployment, wage quantiles, job quality and sector, gender-disaggregated and with confidence intervals. The Dataverse now catalogues **324** resources.

## v10.183.0 — August 5, 2026 (Dataverse: India village boundary shapefiles)

### Added

- **India Village Boundary Shapefiles** added to the Dataverse (Geospatial category) — official village-level administrative boundary polygons for every state and UT, downloadable per state as Shapefile / GeoJSON / KML from the National Water Informatics Centre (Ministry of Jal Shakti) portal. The Dataverse now catalogues **323** resources.

## v10.182.0 — August 5, 2026 (Store: email-first checkout on all product pages)

### Changed

- **Product pages now ask for your email before showing the UPI payment details.** Across all 57 downloadable-product pages, the buy box shows Name + Email first; the QR code, UPI ID and WhatsApp option only appear after you enter a valid email. This captures the delivery address up front (so a completed payment can never be left with nowhere to send the file) and means orders are logged the moment someone proceeds to pay. Purely a checkout-flow change — prices, products and the confirm-and-deliver pipeline are unchanged.

## v10.181.0 — July 31, 2026 (Scheme Tracker: explorer-style "compose a question" bar)

### Changed

- **Scheme Tracker** now opens with the Data Room's signature **fill-in-the-blank** interaction: *"Show me schemes in [sector], reviewed by [the CAG / a parliamentary committee / NITI / official statistics], [nationally / in a state audit]."* Tap the underlined words to narrow the list — a friendlier, guided way in than a bare search box, matching the explorers. The claim-vs-audit cards are unchanged (no ranking or scoring — the findings stay qualitative and sourced).

## v10.180.0 — July 30, 2026 (Data Room: new Scheme Tracker — the claim and the audit)

### For Learners

- **Scheme Tracker** — a new, neutral accountability reference in the Data Room. For **33 major government schemes**, it sets the **official claim** (what a ministry announced) beside the **official finding** (what the government's own auditor — the Comptroller & Auditor General — parliamentary committees, NITI Aayog, or official statistics reported) — side by side, both cited, no commentary. Search by name, filter by sector. Every finding is labelled *national* or *state audit*, and *audit* or *official record*, so nothing is overstated. Built for practitioners who work with these schemes and need both the announcement and the audit.

## v10.179.0 — July 30, 2026 (Energy Explorer: deeper — 5 state measures, 7 national trends)

### For Learners

- **Energy Explorer, expanded** — the new explorer now goes much deeper. **Five state measures** (renewable potential, installed renewables, total installed capacity, coal reserves, and a derived *"how much of its potential each state has actually built"* view — Punjab leads at 24%, Rajasthan sits at just 6% of its vast headroom). **Seven national trends** across the decade: capacity, generation, consumption, coal production, per-capita electricity (748→1,106 kWh), energy intensity (efficiency rising), and the renewable share of power (6%→12%). Now cross-checked against the Central Electricity Authority, with the two official per-capita figures (MoSPI 1,106 kWh vs CEA ~1,395 kWh) explained rather than hidden.

## v10.178.0 — July 30, 2026 (Data Room: new Energy Explorer — the 10th explorer)

### For Learners

- **Energy Explorer** — a new Data Room explorer on India's power system, by state: the **renewable energy each state could generate**, the renewables it has **actually built**, and the **coal still under its ground** — plus a decade of the national picture (installed capacity, electricity generation and coal production). Rank the states, track the national trend, or read the full table. Every figure is transcribed verbatim from *Energy Statistics India 2025* (MoSPI), with the demand-side gaps (no state-level consumption in this source) disclosed plainly. The Data Room is now **10 explorers**.

## v10.177.0 — July 30, 2026 (Fix: ToC blog graphic — pathway labels were on the wrong sides)

### Fixed

- **"Theory of Change for Complex Programmes" blog graphic** — a reader (thank you, Jim) spotted that the balance illustration had the two "pathways" labels swapped: Linear Theory of Change was mislabelled *Emergent Pathways* and Systems Theory of Change *Predictable Pathways*. Corrected so **Linear → Predictable Pathways** and **Systems → Emergent Pathways** (each icon moved with its label).

## v10.176.0 — July 30, 2026 (Products page: alphabetical order within each section)

### Changed

- **Products page** — items within each section (course notes, templates, annotated bare acts, and the rest) are now listed **alphabetically** instead of insertion order, so the long lists (18 course notes especially) are easy to scan. No products, prices or links changed — only order.

## v10.175.0 — July 30, 2026 (Dataverse: added Indian Open Maps)

### For Learners

- **Indian Open Maps** added to the Dataverse (Geospatial & Mapping) — free, open geospatial data for India: vector layers (administrative boundaries, roads, buildings) and raster (topographic maps, satellite imagery), for GIS and mapping work. Brings the catalogue to 322 sources.

## v10.174.0 — July 30, 2026 (Studios: build-first pass across the course-like ones)

### Changed

- **Seven more Interactive Studios now open on the build**, not an explainer — the same "Build is tab 1" treatment piloted on DPI, applied where the audit found studios leading with concept tabs:
  - **Systems Thinking** → opens on *Designing Systems Interventions*
  - **Policy Brief** → opens on *Write a Complete Policy Brief*
  - **Conflict-Sensitive Programming** → opens on *Designing a Conflict-Sensitive Programme*
  - **Ethics in Research** → opens on *building an informed-consent form*
  - **Participatory Methods** → opens on *Community Mapping*
  - **Data Feminism** → opens on the *re-analysis case study*
  - **Urban Boundaries** → opens on *Redraw with Satellites*
- In each, the make-something tab is now tab 1 with the concept tabs following as reference, and tab-switching resolves panels by a stable id so navigation stays intact. **NVC** and **Sampling Design** already opened on their builders and were left as-is.

## v10.173.0 — July 30, 2026 (DPI studio: Build is now literally tab 1)

### Changed

- **Digital Public Infrastructure studio** — the tab bar is now physically reordered so **"Build a programme" is tab 1**, with the concept tabs (What is DPI, Aadhaar, UPI, Governance) following as steps 2–6 and Done last. Tab switching was rewritten to resolve panels by a stable id rather than DOM position, and the Next/Back flow now reads build-first end to end (Build → learn the rails → … → Done).

## v10.172.0 — July 30, 2026 (DPI studio reframed build-first — pilot)

### Changed

- **Digital Public Infrastructure studio** (`/labs/dpi-lab`) now **opens straight into building** — you land on "Build: design a DPI-enabled programme" (a worked scholarship case study + a design-your-own maternal-health exercise) instead of five explainer tabs first. The concept tabs (What is DPI, Aadhaar, UPI, the DPDP Act) become on-demand reference. A pilot for a broader "lead with making, not explaining" pass across the studios.

## v10.171.0 — July 30, 2026 (Studios count corrected to 34; two mis-filed items rehomed)

### Changed

- **Interactive Studios count corrected from 36 to 34.** The "36" had quietly included two things that aren't hands-on studios: **R & Python for Development** (an early-access *course* — 7 modules, its button already said "Open course") and the **Sampling Toolkit** (a thin "which one do I need?" chooser fronting the existing Sampling Basics and Sampling Design studios). The real number of build-a-thing studios is **34**, now consistent across the studios page, homepage, catalogue, docs and counts.
- **R & Python** is reclassified as a course (removed from the studio grid; catalogue and search index now list it as a course).
- **Sampling Toolkit retired** — it held no unique content, so `/labs/sampling-toolkit` now redirects to the **Sampling Design** studio it fronted. Nothing is lost; both sampling studios remain.

## v10.170.0 — July 29, 2026 (Products page: one consistent header level for every category)

### Changed

- **Products page** — every product category now uses the same large section heading. Previously seven categories (Assessment Banks, Templates, Workbooks, Trainer Decks, Refresher Sheets, Formulae Posters, Checklists) sat as *small* sub-headings under one "Templates, Workbooks, Decks & Quick References" umbrella, while every other category (Course Notes, Annotated Bare Acts, Programs, Calculators…) had a large heading — a visibly uneven mix. They're now all first-class sections with a large heading and a short one-line intro that states the format and price. The only remaining small headings are the two genuine sub-groups *inside* Practice Packs (Method Packs / Subject Packs).

## v10.169.0 — July 29, 2026 (Products page: dedicated Annotated Bare Acts section + consistent pricing)

### Changed

- **Products page** — the five Annotated Bare Acts (RTI, DPDP, How Your NGO Exists, Labour Laws, 12A/12AB/80G) now have their **own "Annotated Bare Acts" section** instead of being mixed into the flagship course-notes grid, so the legal guides are easy to find.
- **Consistent price labelling** — every section title is now price-free; the price sits only in the small grey sub-heading tier (e.g. "Course notes · PDF · ₹350 each") and on each product card, matching the rest of the page. Removes the one section ("Flagship Course Notes") that had baked the price into its large heading.

### Fixed

- **Products page light/dark toggle** — the theme buttons did nothing because the page's colour palette only responded to the older `body.dark-mode` hook, while the site's shared toggle sets `data-theme`/`.dark` on `<html>`. The palette now responds to both, so Light / Dark / System switch the page as expected.

## v10.168.0 — July 29, 2026 (New Data Room explorer — IHDS: untouchability, still practised)

### For Learners

- **IHDS Explorer — untouchability, still practised** (`/ihds.html`) — the ninth explorer in the Data Room, and the first on caste and social exclusion. Drawing on the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II 2011-12, via Thorat & Joshi in EPW), it shows one of the survey's most-cited findings: **more than one in four households (27%)** said someone in the home practises untouchability. The explorer maps the national figure, the regional pattern (highest in central and north India, lowest in the east and far south), and the states the study named, highest to lowest. Because the complete 36-state table sits in the paywalled paper, the explorer shows only the publicly and consistently reported figures — and says so plainly: in-between states are omitted, not estimated.

## v10.167.0 — July 29, 2026 (Annotated Bare Acts — 12A, 12AB & 80G Tax Exemption)

### For Learners

- **12A, 12AB & 80G — Tax Exemption for NGOs, Annotated** (`/products/tax-exemption-annotated/`) — the fifth Annotated Bare Act: the three Income-tax Act provisions that decide whether your NGO, and the people who fund it, pay tax. **§ 12A** and **§ 12AB** make your organisation's own income exempt; **§ 80G** gives your donors a deduction. Covers the 2020–21 registration overhaul (provisional vs regular registration, Forms 10A and 10AB, the six-months-before renewal deadline), the **Finance Act 2025** change extending validity to ten years for smaller trusts, the 80G deduction and its ₹2,000 cash cap, and the annual **Form 10BD/10BE** donation return your donors' deductions now depend on. A practitioner compliance digest with a development-sector note per provision. 3-page print-ready PDF, ₹350.

## v10.166.0 — July 29, 2026 (Annotated Bare Acts — Labour Laws for NGOs)

### For Learners

- **Labour Laws for NGOs, Annotated** (`/products/labour-laws-annotated/`) — the fourth Annotated Bare Act, and the one that completes the compliance set: every employment-law duty that lands the moment your NGO has staff, in one place. **EPF** (20-employee threshold, 12% match), **ESI** (10 employees / ₹21,000 wage ceiling), **Gratuity** (five-year rule, 15 days' wages a year), **Maternity Benefit** (26 weeks paid, anti-dismissal protection), state **Shops & Establishments** registration, **Contract Labour** (when you become a "principal employer"), and the **volunteers-vs-employees** classification test that is the sector's most common labour risk. Written as a practitioner compliance digest — who each law applies to, the core duty, and a development-sector note — with the four Labour Codes (2019–2020) clearly flagged. A 3-page print-ready PDF, ₹350.

## v10.165.0 — July 29, 2026 (Annotated Bare Acts — How Your NGO Exists)

### For Learners

- **How Your NGO Exists — Trusts, Societies & Section 8, Annotated** (`/products/ngo-formation-annotated/`) — the third Annotated Bare Act, and the first spanning several statutes: the three legal vehicles an Indian NGO can take. The core provisions of the **Indian Trusts Act 1882** (s. 6), the **Societies Registration Act 1860** (ss. 1, 4, 5, 6) and the **Companies Act 2013** (s. 8), reproduced verbatim from India Code, each with a development-sector practitioner's note — the "three certainties" of a trust deed (and the crucial caveat that the 1882 Act doesn't govern public charitable trusts), the society's seven-member floor and life-keeping annual filing, and the Section 8 company's credibility-and-compliance trade-off. A 7-page print-ready PDF, ₹350.

## v10.164.0 — July 29, 2026 (Annotated Bare Acts — DPDP Act 2023)

### For Learners

- **The DPDP Act, 2023 — Annotated for the Development Sector** (`/products/dpdp-annotated/`) — the second Annotated Bare Act: the Digital Personal Data Protection Act reproduced word-for-word from India Code (illustrations and all), with a development-sector practitioner's note beside each of seven core sections (§§ 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 33). Written for NGOs that hold beneficiary lists, run consent forms, take photographs, or work with children — consent that actually holds up, the verifiable parental consent now required for a child's data, vendor and breach duties, and the erasure obligation. A 9-page print-ready PDF, ₹350.

## v10.163.0 — July 29, 2026 (New paid product: Annotated Bare Acts — RTI Act)

### For Learners

- **The RTI Act, 2005 — Annotated for the Development Sector** (`/products/rti-annotated/`) — a new kind of ImpactMojo product: the actual statute, reproduced word-for-word from the authoritative India Code text, with a plain-language reading and a **development-sector practitioner's note** beside each of the seven core sections (§§ 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 19, 20) — RTI as the spine of a social audit, the "no reason required" shield, the public-interest override, the penalty clause as leverage. A 10-page print-ready PDF, ₹350. The first in an Annotated Bare Acts line — the paid companion to the free [RTI Act for the Social Sector](/law-guides/) explainer.
- **Related free courses on the law notes page** — the Constitution & Law course-notes product now cross-links the free courses that pair with it (Indian Constitution 101, Public Policy, Public Choice, Nothing About Us Without Us, Environmental Justice 101, Social Movements).

## v10.162.0 — July 29, 2026 (Challenge submissions: optional feedback email)

### For Learners

- **Get feedback on your challenge responses** — when you submit a Live Case Challenge you can now leave your email (optional) so we can reply with personal feedback. Signed-in learners get the field pre-filled automatically; leave it blank to stay anonymous as before.

## v10.161.0 — July 29, 2026 (New: Law Guides — Indian laws for the social sector)

### For Learners

A new content category: **Law Guides** (`/law-guides/`) — plain-English explainers of the Indian laws that shape development work, written for practitioners rather than lawyers. Each guide covers who the law applies to, what it obliges you to do, the gray areas nobody resolves for you, collapsible FAQs, and an interactive compliance checklist that remembers your progress.

- **The FCRA for the Social Sector** — foreign funding rules: registration vs prior permission, the SBI Delhi account, the sub-granting ban, and how organisations actually lose their licence.
- **CSR Law for the Social Sector** — Section 135's 2% obligation, Schedule VII, CSR-1 registration for NGOs, unspent-funds timelines, and statutory impact assessment.
- **The POSH Act for the Social Sector** — Internal Committees, the "workplace" that follows field work, statutory timelines, and what small NGOs must do.
- **The RTI Act for the Social Sector** — using RTI as an advocacy and evidence tool, filing applications that work, and when your own NGO counts as a "public authority."
- **Child Protection Laws for the Social Sector** — POCSO and the JJ Act: the mandatory reporting duty on every staff member, CCI registration, and the CWC/Childline machinery.
- **The RPwD Act for the Social Sector** — disability rights: employer duties, reasonable accommodation, accessibility standards, and inclusive programming.

## v10.160.0 — July 28, 2026 (14 new Reading Companions — 149 → 163)

### For Learners

## v10.159.0 — July 27, 2026 (The Data Room — one home for all 8 explorers)

### For Learners

- **The Data Room** (`/explorers.html`) — the eight data explorers now have a single front door. One page gathers all of them, grouped by theme — *Education* (ASER, UDISE+, NAS, AISHE), *Health & the household* (NFHS), *Work & movement* (PLFS, Migration) and *Democracy & voice* (Election Turnout) — each card leading with the plain question it answers. The navigation menu's eight separate links collapse into one tidy **Data Room** entry, and the page is a clean, shareable link for teaching. Same promise as every explorer: the government's own numbers, validated and source-linked, down to your district where the data allows.

## v10.158.0 — July 27, 2026 (NAS Explorer — district drill-down + skill breakdown)

### For Learners

- **The NAS Learning Explorer now goes down to the district — and the individual skill.** Two new views: **Zoom into the districts** ranks all of a state's districts on any class and subject (720 districts in all), and **Break down the skills** shows, for a single district, the exact learning outcomes its students struggle with most — *"solves problems involving rational numbers," "interprets bar charts and pie charts"* — each against the national average. The district ranking is transparently derived from the official district learning-outcome data (it reproduces the official subject scores within about half a point); the skill breakdown is the exact, official competency figure. Now you can find your own district and see precisely where its children are being left behind.

## v10.157.0 — July 27, 2026 (New: NAS + Election Turnout Explorers — the suite is complete)

### For Learners

- **NAS Learning Explorer** (`/nas.html`) — the curriculum-aligned companion to ASER: where ASER asks whether a child can read *at all*, the **National Achievement Survey** asks how much of the actual *syllabus* government-school students have mastered, in Classes 3, 5, 8 and 10, across language, maths, science and social science. Rank every state and switch classes to watch mastery slide from ~60% correct in Class 3 to the mid-30s by Class 10. National averages validated against the published NAS 2021 report. Source: NCERT.
- **Election Turnout Explorer** (`/eci.html`) — the last stop on the life-course: after learning, health, work and migration, the vote. See **voter turnout in the 2024 Lok Sabha election** ranked across every state — from Lakshadweep's 84% to the low-50s in the big northern states — reconstructing the official **65.79%** national figure exactly, with women turning out at near parity with men. Source: Election Commission of India (via OpenCity).
- **Eight explorers, one story.** The homepage now has a dedicated **Data Explorers** section gathering all eight — ASER, UDISE+, NAS, NFHS, AISHE, PLFS, Migration and Election Turnout — a continuous, source-linked arc from a child's first reading test to the ballot box.

## v10.156.0 — July 27, 2026 (New: Migration Explorer)

### For Learners

- **Migration Explorer** (`/migration.html`) — how many Indians live somewhere other than where they usually lived. Explore the **migration rate** (people whose last usual residence differs from their current home) across 36 states, split **rural and urban** — from Chandigarh and the metros (high in-migration) to the low-mobility north-east. The headline: **nearly three in ten Indians are migrants**, highest in cities, and led overall by **women moving at marriage** while men move mainly for work. National rate (29.1%) validated against the published *Migration in India 2020-21* report. Source: MoSPI (NSS 78th round).

## v10.155.0 — July 27, 2026 (New: PLFS Workforce Explorer)

### For Learners

- **PLFS Workforce Explorer** (`/plfs.html`) — where the learning ladder (ASER → UDISE+ → AISHE) finally meets the economy. Explore India's official employment data — **labour-force participation, worker ratio and unemployment**, ranked across 36 states and by gender, plus the national trend since 2017-18. The story it leads with is the **women's-participation gap and its fast closing**: female labour-force participation has climbed from about **23% in 2017-18 to nearly 42% in 2023-24**, even as it still trails men's ~79%. Ask your question in plain language and see which states pull women into the workforce and which leave them out. National figures validated against the published PLFS 2023-24 report. Source: MoSPI.

## v10.154.0 — July 27, 2026 (New: AISHE Higher-Education Explorer)

### For Learners

- **AISHE Higher-Education Explorer** (`/aishe.html`) — the final rung of the learning-ladder suite (after ASER and UDISE+): how many young Indians actually reach college. Explore the **Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)** — enrolment as a share of the 18–23 age group — **ranked across 35 states and by gender**, plus the **national climb from 2011-12 to 2021-22** and the striking **gender-parity crossover**: women now enrol in higher education at a higher rate than men (GPI passed 1.0 in 2018-19). Ask your question in plain language and compare a state's college-going rate with how its children read (ASER) and how its schools are equipped (UDISE+). Source: AISHE, Ministry of Education.

## v10.153.0 — July 27, 2026 (New: UDISE+ School Inputs Explorer)

### For Learners

- **UDISE+ School Inputs Explorer** (`/udise.html`) — a new interactive data product, and the companion to the ASER explorer: ASER asks *did children learn*, this asks *was the school even equipped to teach them*. See the share of schools with electricity, drinking water, a functional girls' toilet, a library, a computer, internet and disabled-access ramps — plus pupil-teacher ratios, enrolment and dropout — **ranked across states, drilled into 782 districts, and tracked from 2021-22 to 2024-25**. Ask your question in plain language, zoom into your own state's districts, and watch what has (and hasn't) improved. Every figure is pulled live from the official UDISE+ open data (Ministry of Education) and cross-checked so district numbers sum to state totals.

## v10.152.0 — July 27, 2026 (Data explorers — shared look + more context)

### For Learners

- **The ASER and NFHS explorers now feel like one product family.** Both open the same way — a shared header, hero, "how to read" guide and question composer — instead of looking like two unrelated tools. The **ASER Explorer** gained a plain-language *"What is ASER — and why it matters"* primer, a *"How to read this explorer"* box, an at-a-glance stats strip, and a fuller *"Making sense of the numbers"* section that explains what a "pass" means, how to read the 2022 dip and the private-vs-government gap responsibly, and where every figure comes from. (It also fixes a bug that had been hiding ASER's sources and methodology on the live page.)

## v10.151.0 — July 27, 2026 (ASER Explorer — district drill-down)

### For Learners

- **Zoom into the districts.** The ASER Explorer has a new **district** view: pick a state and rank every one of its surveyed districts for 2024, by the share of children who can read a Std II text or do arithmetic. It follows ASER&rsquo;s own bands &mdash; **Std III&ndash;V** and **Std VI&ndash;VIII** &mdash; with the state average marked, and it names any district whose sample was too small to report. **605 districts across 27 states**, compiled from ASER 2024&rsquo;s district &ldquo;Performance of districts&rdquo; estimates and cross-checked against each state total.

## v10.150.0 — July 26, 2026 (ASER Explorer — by school type, every state, every round)

### For Learners

- **The ASER Explorer now splits every state by school type.** Ask for **government**, **private**, or **all** children and rank the states, read a table, or trace one state&rsquo;s **government-vs-private-vs-all** trend across all six rounds (**2012 &rarr; 2024**), for reading and arithmetic in Std III/V/VIII. Compiled and cross-validated from the ASER 2016 and 2024 state pages &mdash; e.g. All-India government Std III reading in 2024 (23.4%) matches ASER&rsquo;s own figure exactly.

## v10.149.0 — July 26, 2026 (ASER Explorer — full time series back to 2012)

### For Learners

- **ASER Explorer now goes back to 2012.** The state Rank, Table and Trend views cover six survey rounds &mdash; **2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024** &mdash; so you can see the full arc, including the pandemic dip and the 2024 recovery, for reading and arithmetic in Std III/V/VIII across 25 of 27 states (Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Sikkim from 2018). Compiled from the ASER 2016 state pages and the ASER 2024 report, with every value cross-checked against the reports&rsquo; All-India figures.

## v10.148.0 — July 26, 2026 (Ask-the-data question composers)

### For Learners

- **Ask a question in plain language** — the **ASER Explorer** and the **NFHS District Explorer** now open with a fill-in-the-blanks sentence you complete to drive the data. Tap the underlined words to change what you're asking — e.g. "Rank the states by the share of Std III children who can read a Std II-level text in 2024", or "Across India's 706 districts, show child stunting and how it changed since NFHS-4". A friendlier way in than knobs and menus (the detailed controls are still there underneath).

## v10.147.0 — July 26, 2026 (ASER Learning Explorer)

### For Learners

- **ASER Explorer** (`/aser.html`) — a new interactive data product in the Showcase, built on India's Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). See what share of children can read a Std II text or do basic arithmetic: **rank** all 27 states, watch the **national trend by school type** (government vs private vs all, 2014–2024), and read the full **skill ladder** — the rung-by-rung distribution from "can't read letters" up to "reads a Std II text", grade by grade. Switch subject (reading / arithmetic), grade and year. Source-linked to ASER Centre / Pratham.

## v10.146.0 — July 21, 2026 (New flagship: Social Movements & Protests)

### For Learners

- **Social Movements & Protests** — a new 13-module flagship on how movements form, act, and change society, taught South Asia-first: from collective action and contentious politics through framing, repertoires, and nonviolent resistance, grounded in real cases from Chipko to the 2024–26 Gen Z wave. Comes with a 48-term interactive lexicon, an auto-graded self-check quiz at the end of every module, and a capstone project.

## v10.145.0 — July 21, 2026 (NFHS District Explorer)

### For Learners

- **NFHS District Explorer** — a new interactive data studio mapping how every one of India's 707 districts changed between the last two National Family Health Surveys (2015-16 → 2019-21). Pick from 105 real indicators — child stunting, anaemia, institutional births, immunisation, women's schooling, child marriage, sanitation and more — see the district map recolour, and read the best and worst movers. Every figure is sourced to the official district fact sheets, works on your phone, and reads offline once loaded.

## v10.144.0 — July 20, 2026 (Livelihoods lexicon now reachable)

### For Learners

- **The Livelihoods course lexicon is linked at last** — the 53-term interactive glossary has existed since v10.136.0, but the course page never linked to it. It's now in the sidebar and resource bar, same as every other flagship.

## v10.141.1 — July 19, 2026 (The numbers are right now)

### For Learners

- **The transparency page now shows true all-time numbers** — 120,700 courses started, 727 completed, 468 certificates earned, and ~13,000 learning hours across the platform's whole history, combined from our legacy records and our live numbers. If a metric has no reliable data yet, we hide it rather than show a misleading zero.

## v10.141.0 — July 19, 2026 (Faster everywhere, safer sources, honest numbers)

### For Learners

- **Pages load faster and look right everywhere** — pages load quicker on slow connections and keep their look even on networks where Google services are blocked.
- **Course downloads are complete** — "Download for offline" now saves the whole course including its lexicon, and it stays free for everyone.
- **The Back button behaves in the game library** — closing a game takes you back to the library, not out of the site.
- **Livelihoods course numbers are current** — female labour-force participation updated to the latest PLFS 2023–24 figure (41.7%), with sources named on the page.

## v10.140.0 — July 19, 2026 (Findable games, honest hours, connected reading)

### For Learners

- **Search the game library** — find any of the 135 games by name or topic, and filter by difficulty to match your level.
- **Every course tells you how long it takes** — all 18 flagship courses now show an honest hours estimate up front.
- **Blog posts point you to the course** — every post now links the free course or deck that teaches its topic properly.
- **The Libraries page shows everything** — Deep Dives, Timelines, and Practice Packs now have their own cards there.

## v10.139.0 — July 19, 2026 (Feedback, night reading, and browsable shelves)

### For Learners

- **Score yourself after a challenge** — every Live Case Challenge now lets you rate your submission against the same weighted rubric an evaluator would use, and your submissions show as recorded to your account.
- **Dark mode works on all 51 decks** — the 101 decks now follow your theme choice and your device's night setting, so late-night reading no longer means a blinding white screen.
- **Reading companions are easier to browse** — the giant "Policy" shelf is now six real shelves: Politics & Democracy, Caste, Gender & Society, History & Biography, Social Protection, Policy & Public Administration, and Data & Design.

## v10.138.0 — July 19, 2026 (The everything-fixed release)

### For Learners

- **Forgot your password? It works now.** The reset link in your email leads to a real page where you set a new password — previously it went nowhere, and we're sorry.
- **Your details are private again** — we closed a gap that could have exposed account phone numbers and addresses; only your display name is visible, and only for certificate verification.
- **Law and SEL courses have their real glossaries** — 52 legal terms with landmark cases, and 54 SEL terms across frameworks and classroom practice; Media and Power BI lexicons grew too.
- **Search and offline everywhere** — every page's top bar now has a Search button, and offline support works site-wide; the offline page even lists the courses you've downloaded.
- **Finish what you start** — decks now point you to the matching Studio, course, or game when you finish; games remember completion in the library; and reading companions link back to the collection.
- **Faster decks on slow connections** — 42 of the 101 decks were carrying about 1MB of JavaScript they never used; it's gone.
- **Live, honest numbers** — the practitioners-reached figure across the site now comes from our live records (April 2026 baseline + everyone who registered since) and updates itself.

## v10.137.0 — July 19, 2026 (Every link works, and the numbers are live)

### For Learners

- **Live platform numbers on the transparency page** — registered learners, active learners, courses started and completed, and certificates issued now come straight from our live records, updated on every visit, with an honest note about what the numbers do and don't cover.
- **78 broken links fixed across the site** — games, studios, blog posts and lexicons that pointed at moved or renamed pages now land where they should, and an automatic guard keeps every internal link working from now on.
- **Sharing your certificate looks the part** — paste a certificate verification link into LinkedIn or WhatsApp and the preview now shows your course name and a branded certificate card instead of a generic page title.

## v10.136.0 — July 19, 2026 (Faster, findable, and fully lexiconed)

### For Learners

- **Three new course lexicons** — Livelihoods (53 terms), Media & Communication (50 terms), and Power BI (51 terms) join the flagship lexicon family: searchable, filterable glossaries with definitions and worked examples. Every one of the 18 flagships now has an annotated lexicon.
- **The site got noticeably lighter** — images across the platform were compressed by nearly half (15MB saved) with no visible quality change, and repeat visits now load instantly. Biggest wins on slow connections.
- **Menus are shorter and consistent** — every menu label is now at most two words (Events, Products, Flagships, Workshops, Teach, Dojos, Posters…), with brand names like Deep Dives and Build Circles untouched.
- **Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Marathi caught up** — the Studios naming, the new menu labels, and the instructor page are now translated instead of falling back to English.

### Added

- Structured data for search engines on 230 pages: every foundational deck (Course), reading companion (LearningResource), and blog post (BlogPosting).
- Email notifications wired for seven forms that previously collected submissions silently — including product orders, event registrations, and instructor-kit requests.

### Fixed

- Accessibility audits now run clean: heading order corrected on the homepage, about page and shared footer, and the skip links and share button sit in proper landmarks.

## v10.135.1 — July 19, 2026 (Search fixed + a guard against conflict markers)

### Fixed

- **Site search works again** — the search index had been corrupted by the same merge-conflict accident that garbled the homepage hero; it's repaired with all 921 entries intact, including the 15 new reading companions. The sitemap and this changelog were repaired the same way.

### Added

- **A permanent guard** — the build now fails automatically if git conflict markers ever appear in any file, so this class of accident can't reach the live site again.
- **One quiz, one place** — the mid-page "Not sure where to start?" band is gone; the quiz now lives solely in the hero and opens in one click.

## v10.135.0 — July 19, 2026 (No more walls of cards)

### For Learners

- **The catalog opens as a browsable overview** — instead of one 328-card wall, the default view now shows each content type as its own section (six-card preview + "See all →"), so you can see the whole platform at a glance and dive into any type with one click. Filters, search and tracks work exactly as before.
- **The 101 library is organised by learning track** — the 51 foundational decks now sit under six labelled track sections (MEL & Research, Data & Technology, Policy & Economics, Gender, Philosophy & Law, Health & Communication) instead of one long list.
- **Buttons out of each other's way** — the WhatsApp share button now stacks above the Mojini chat button on pages that have both, instead of covering it.

### Fixed

- Stale counts corrected: flagship landing stat tiles (17→18 courses, 224→233 modules, lexicons now the verified 15), the libraries page's Reading Companions badge (105→149), and the 101 page's footer (16→18 flagships).

## v10.134.2 — July 19, 2026 (15 new reading companions)

### For Learners

- **15 new interactive Reading Companions** — chapter-by-chapter study guides (each with key concepts, a South-Asia lens, critiques and an AI Q&A), bringing the library to 149:
  - **Free Robot Labour: Marx, Automation & the Future of AI** (Jamie Kelly) — could an AI ever be a *capitalist*, not just a worker? A short, sharp open-access read on labour, law and power.
  - **Education for Social Purpose** (Azim Premji University) — a decade of reflections on teaching development for justice, equity and critical practice.
  - **The Design of Everyday Things** (Don Norman) — why good design is invisible, and how to build things people can actually use.
  - **Indian Polity** (M. Laxmikanth) — the standard companion to the Constitution, institutions and governance of India.
  - **The Let Them Theory** (Mel Robbins) — a simple tool for letting go of what you can't control.
  - **Institutionalizing Health Technology Assessment** (WHO) and **Assessing Innovative Health Technologies for Low-Resource Settings** (WHO) — how health systems decide what to fund.
  - **A Framework for the Economic Evaluation of Digital Health Interventions** (World Bank) — putting a value on digital health.
  - **Assessing Gender & Child Budget Statements of Indian States** and **A Decade of Subnational Gender Budgeting in India** — does gender-responsive budgeting actually change outcomes?
  - **The Gastropoetics of the South Asian Diaspora** (Parama Roy) — food, memory and belonging across migration.
  - **Reading Backwards: AI & the Death of the Author** — what AI does to authorship, trust and writing-as-thinking.
  - **The Encyclopedia of Tourism** — a reference companion to tourism as a development and livelihoods field.
  - **Busy Idiots** (productivity & brain science) and **Suddenly Hybrid** (managing modern hybrid meetings) — practical companions for how we work now.

## v10.134.1 — July 19, 2026 (Findability follow-ups)

### Changed

- **Teach with ImpactMojo is now easy to find** — linked from the shared footer on every page and the homepage footer's Learn column, alongside the existing Services → For Instructors menu entry.
- **Footer says Studios** — the shared footer's "Labs" link label updated to the new name.
- **Sampling Toolkit left the navigation** — it's one of the 35 studios, so it now lives with the rest of them (Studios page, catalog, and search) instead of holding a top-level menu slot.
- **Handouts page counts agree with themselves** — the stat tile now counts the same 89 HTML handouts the hero describes.

## v10.134.0 — July 19, 2026 (Studios, a fixed catalog, and a smarter starting quiz)

### For Learners

- **Labs are now Studios** — the 35 free hands-on workbenches have a new name across the site. Same tools, same links, clearer identity: studios are where you build real artefacts — a Theory of Change, a LogFrame, a sampling plan, a survey instrument.
- **The catalog works again** — a bug had silently emptied the full catalog page; it now shows all 320+ items with filter counts that update themselves, including eight items that had never been listed (the four newest 101 courses, the LogFrame Builder, the Sampling Toolkit, and two Deep Dives).
- **A smarter starting quiz** — the homepage quiz now asks how experienced you are and recommends one clear next step: foundations first if you're new, the full flagship if you're not. The homepage remembers your path and greets you with it until you start a course.
- **Live Case Challenges, organized as a ladder** — the challenges page now reads Start here → Build range → Test yourself instead of one long wall of cards.
- **Teach with ImpactMojo** (`/teach.html`) — a new page for professors, trainers and team leads: three ways to run ImpactMojo in a classroom or cohort, what's in a teaching kit, plain-language licensing, and a form to request a syllabus-mapped instructor kit.
- **A refreshed homepage tour** — up-to-date content, new stops for search (Ctrl+K) and the starting quiz, and the site's indigo look.

### Fixed

- Certificates earned on the nine newer flagship courses now appear in the badge wallet with Add-to-LinkedIn buttons (they were silently skipped before).
- The founder cards at the bottom of the homepage are properly sized on desktop.
- Page-template headings were invisible in light mode on template-derived pages (missing gradient definition) — fixed in the template.
- Search results and structured data updated for the Studios naming; five top studios now carry rich structured data for search engines.

## v10.133.0 — July 19, 2026 (See your progress, know the time, pick up where you left off)

### For Learners

- **Course progress is now visible on every flagship** — the module progress bar, sidebar checkmarks and completion celebration now appear on all 18 flagship courses as you answer each module's questions, whichever course you're studying.
- **Know the time before you start** — every flagship module now shows a reading-time estimate (~minutes) in the course sidebar, with a whole-course total next to the progress bar, so you can plan a session before you dive in.
- **Pick up where you left off** — if you've started a flagship course, the homepage now greets you with a one-line "Continue where you left off" shortcut straight back to it, showing how many modules you've completed.
- **Three newest flagships now work offline** — Designing What Works, Nothing About Us Without Us, and Nonviolence in Practice joined the courses you can download and read without a connection.

### Changed

- **A calmer first visit** — on your very first view of the homepage, the floating tool buttons stay out of the way so the page lands clean; they appear from your next page onward.
- **Homepage polish** — the "Development Know-How" badge no longer hides behind the header on desktop, and the Start Exploring button now wears the site's own indigo colours.

### Fixed

- Stale content counts corrected across the site (catalog description, transparency page, README, FAQ and platform overview) — all now consistent at 69 courses · 18 flagship · 35 labs · 22 Deep Dives.

## v10.132.0 — July 16, 2026 (All flagships standardized — mini-projects, coaching & capstones)

### For Learners

- **Every flagship module now ends with a "Try it in your work" mini-project** — 203 new hands-on tasks across all 17 remaining flagship courses (MEL, Gender, Public Policy, Development Economics, Gandhi, Law, Media, SEL, NVC & Restorative Justice, Livelihoods, Causal Inference, Data Visualization, Power BI, Public Choice, Interventions, Dev-AI and more), each a concrete step you apply to your own programme or context — matching the depth the disability flagship reached last release.
- **More coaching, evenly spread** — 50 additional coaching prompts (Vandana and Varna) fill the modules that had none, so every flagship carries the same alternating 1:1 coaching cues throughout.
- **Two new capstone projects** — the Development Economics AI (Dev-AI) and Livelihoods flagships now close with a full capstone that synthesizes the whole course into one deliverable, bringing every flagship to the same end-to-end standard.

## v10.131.0 — July 16, 2026 (Disability flagship depth + Dataverse polish)

### For Learners

- **Nothing About Us Without Us — richer modules** — every module of the disability flagship now carries a "Try it in your work" mini-project (a concrete, apply-it-to-your-programme task) and two coaching prompts (both Vandana and Varna), bringing it to the same depth as the other flagship courses.

### Changed

- **Dataverse** — centered the hero, featured the new Competency & Learning Rubrics tool, and updated the resource count (320 → 321).
- **Tours** now run on the homepage only (removed from the Dataverse, Premium, and Transparency pages).
- **Libraries landing** — removed items that already have a Showcase-menu home (Deep Dives, Timelines, Marginalia, Research to Action); gave the Data Notes and Live Projects nav items distinct icons.

## v10.130.0 — July 16, 2026 (Competency & Learning Rubrics in the Dataverse)

### For Learners

- **Competency & Learning Rubrics** (`/dataverse-rubrics.html`) — a new interactive Dataverse tool: 16 competencies that development work runs on (critical thinking, ethical reasoning, quantitative & information literacy, communication, teamwork, intercultural & global learning, and more), each with criteria scored across four performance levels. Explore any rubric, self-assess a person, proposal or programme, and export the assessment. Adapted for development practice from the AAC&U VALUE Rubrics.

## v10.129.0 — July 16, 2026 (Course notes for the disability flagship)

### For Learners

- **Nothing About Us Without Us — Course Notes (PDF)** (`/products/notes-nothing-about-us/`) — the complete 9-module disability flagship as one printable PDF you can keep, print and annotate. The course itself stays free to study online; the notes are the optional keep-and-print version, ₹350. This completes course notes for all 18 flagships.

## v10.128.0 — July 15, 2026 (New flagship — Nothing About Us Without Us: Disability, Justice & Development)

### For Learners

- **Nothing About Us Without Us: Disability, Justice & Development** (`/courses/nothing-about-us/`) — ImpactMojo's **18th flagship course** and its first full course dedicated to disability. Nine modules, South-Asia-centred: models and history (medical → social → disability justice); the CRPD and disability law across the region (India's RPwD Act 2016, plus Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka); counting disability with the Washington Group questions and the politics of data; barriers and accessibility; disability and development across sectors; intersectionality (gender, caste, invisible disabilities); inclusive programming and MEL; the region's disability movements and culture; and ethics and allyship. It foregrounds South Asian scholars and activists (Anita Ghai, Renu Addlakha, Nandini Ghosh, Javed Abidi, Nidhi Goyal, Malini Chib and others) and draws on the global canon as complement. Module 1 is free; the rest are free with a sign-in. Pairs with the **Disability-Inclusive MEL Lab** and **Disability Inclusion 101**. Built with, not just about, disabled people.

## v10.127.0 — July 15, 2026 (Disability-Inclusive MEL Lab — disability, made countable)

### For Learners

- **Disability-Inclusive MEL Lab** (`/Labs/disability-inclusive-mel-lab.html`) — a new free lab that turns disability inclusion from a value into something you can actually measure. Ground your MEL in the social model and the twin-track approach; count disability the right way with the **Washington Group Short Set** (six functional-difficulty questions and the standard cut-off, with an interactive walk-through); draft **disability-inclusive and disability-specific SMART indicators**; and score whether your data collection is genuinely accessible (formats, accommodations, inclusive sampling, "nothing about us without us", safeguarding). Exports a disability-inclusive MEL plan. The hands-on companion to Disability Inclusion 101, and ImpactMojo's first interactive tool dedicated to disability. Brings the Labs collection to **35**.

## v10.126.0 — July 15, 2026 (Indian Data Navigator moves into the Dataverse)

### For Learners

- **Indian Data Navigator** now lives in the **Dataverse** at [`/dataverse-india.html`](/dataverse-india.html) instead of Labs. It's a guide to India's data *sources* — which is exactly what the Dataverse is for — rather than a build-something workbench, so it's a better fit there. Same tool, same features (search, filter, shortlist, export a data-sourcing plan); the old link redirects automatically. It's now featured at the top of the Dataverse.

## v10.125.0 — July 15, 2026 (Two data-literacy labs — Indian Data Navigator & Why City Boundaries Lie)

### For Learners

- **Indian Data Navigator** (`/Labs/indian-data-guide-lab.html`) — a new free lab that helps you find the right Indian dataset for your question instead of guessing. A searchable, filterable field-guide to India's major public data — Census, NSS, PLFS, HCES, NFHS, ASER, U-DISE+, SRS, HMIS, SECC, IHDS, SHRUG, NCRB and more — with, for each source, what it actually measures, its unit and geographic granularity, how often it comes out, where to get it (free or paid), and the caveats that will trip you up. Shortlist the sources you'll use and **export a data-sourcing plan**, plus a primer on matching a question to the right dataset and triangulating across sources. No sign-in; saves to your browser.
- **Why City Boundaries Lie** (`/Labs/urban-boundaries-lab.html`) — a new free interactive lesson on why administrative city borders don't match the real, economic city (Noida is functionally Delhi yet officially separate; Dhaka's limits swallow farmland while missing dense settlements). Toggle a schematic map between administrative and economic boundaries, see how India's Census rule **undercounts** its urban population, and use a mini-classifier to apply the 2-of-3 satellite rule (population, built-up area, night-lights) that redraws cities from space — with a handoff to Development Data Lab's open Global Urban Boundaries dataset. Brings the Labs collection to **35**.

## v10.124.0 — July 15, 2026 (RCT Readiness Diagnostic — should you even run a trial?)

### For Learners

- **RCT Readiness Diagnostic** (`/Labs/rct-readiness-lab.html`) — a new free lab that answers the question NGOs rarely get to ask out loud: *should we commit to an expensive randomised trial at all — and are we ready?* It walks through five honest checks — where your evidence really sits on the hierarchy (and why an RCT isn't the summit you must climb to), whether your intervention and theory of change are stress-tested, whether your rollout can support **ethical** randomisation, whether your **baseline even has room to detect the change** (the ceiling/floor trap that quietly sinks trials), and whether an RCT is the right tool at all. Includes a baseline detectability and power calculator, a go/no-go readiness verdict, an honest cost-and-ethics ledger, and a table of cheaper, faster alternatives (evaluability assessment, process tracing, contribution analysis, quasi-experimental designs) for when you're not ready. The gate that belongs *before* the Impact Evaluation Designer. No sign-in; saves to your browser; works offline. Brings the Labs collection to **33**.

## v10.123.0 — July 13, 2026 (LogFrame Builder — a new MEL lab)

### For Learners

- **LogFrame Builder** (`/Labs/logframe-builder-lab.html`) — a new free lab that turns your Theory of Change into a donor-ready **Logical Framework**. Climb the results ladder from Goal to Activities, attach SMART indicators and their means of verification, name the assumptions that hold your logic together, then print or export the classic 4×4 matrix. It **imports directly from the Theory of Change Builder** so you never start from a blank page, and ships with a worked example. No sign-in; saves to your browser; works offline. Brings the Labs collection to **32**.

## v10.122.0 — July 13, 2026 (Marginalia — The Theory of Change is now illustrated)

### For Learners

- **The Theory of Change** Marginalia essay is now fully illustrated — all ten hand-drawn blue-ink panels are in. The essay reads as intended: drawn joke on top, cited footnotes underneath. Images are web-optimised (~340 KB each) so the page stays light on mobile.

## v10.121.0 — July 13, 2026 (CSR in India map — real data + a site-wide share button)

### For Learners

- **CSR in India: The Money and Where It Goes** (`/maps/csr-india.html`) — a new interactive map built from **real figures**: India's ₹34,909 crore of corporate CSR in FY2023-24, the sectors it flows into (health & sanitation, education, environment, rural), and the ten biggest corporate spenders — every node sized by actual rupees. The companion school-education funding map now also carries the real education-CSR total (~₹11,300 cr).

### Added

- A shared, prefilled **"Share ImpactMojo on WhatsApp"** button now appears on every page (injected via `site-chrome.js`, homepage included).
- **Timelines** and **Research to Action** added to the Specials → Showcase navigation.

## v10.120.0 — July 13, 2026 (Interactive Maps — Content Map & Funding Map)

### For Learners

- **Content Map** (`/maps/content-map.html`) — an interactive topic constellation of the whole platform, built live from the search index. Drag, zoom, and click any theme to see the courses, dives, games, and readings behind it.
- **Funding Map: Indian School Education** (`/maps/funding-map.html`) — an illustrative, interactive map of who funds and runs what in India's school-education ecosystem — corporate foundations, philanthropies, NGOs, and the government systems they converge on. A first proof of concept built from publicly documented relationships (no rupee figures; honest about what it can and can't show).

### Added

- New `/maps/` section with a landing page and a lightweight, dependency-free force-directed graph engine (`maps/graph.js`) shared by both maps — canvas-rendered, theme-aware, with zoom/pan, drag, hover highlighting, and click-through side panels. Verified rendering in a real browser (headless Chromium).
- Homepage "Maps" card, plus `search-index.json` and `sitemap.xml` entries.

## v10.119.0 — July 13, 2026 (Fix — the Premium page tour)

### Fixed

- **The guided tour on the Premium page works again.** It had been pointing at an old page layout (from before the tiers were renamed Explorer / Practitioner / Professional / Team), so it silently never started. It now walks through each tier with accurate, up-to-date descriptions.


## v10.118.0 — July 13, 2026 (New Reading Companion — Dalit Feminist Discourse)

### For Learners

- **Dalit Feminist Discourse: Voices in Dalit Writings** (eds. Charu Arya & Nabanita Deka, Routledge, 2025) — a new interactive Reading Companion to this 15-chapter anthology on Dalit feminist thought and women's writing: the "difference" debate with savarna feminism, Brahmanical patriarchy, Dalit women's autobiography and poetry, and the aesthetics of testimonio — connected throughout to gender-justice practice in South Asia.

## v10.118.0 — July 13, 2026 (New Data Note, Deep Dive & a Marginalia essay)

### For Learners

- **The wage that ran to stand still** — a new Data Note on India's MGNREGA wage: roughly quadrupled on paper since 2006, yet barely moved in real terms because it rises only with prices — and now below the state minimum wage across much of the country. Two original charts, with the numbers and their caveats laid out honestly.
- **Water, Sanitation, and the Behaviour Gap** — a new Deep Dive reading list on WASH in South Asia: why toilets get built and not used, why open defecation persisted even where people could afford not to, what actually changes behaviour, and how to read the Swachh Bharat Mission's claims. 14 annotated readings across four sections.

### Added

- **Marginalia essay 5 — "The Theory of Change."** The logic-model industry meets the district it diagrams: the theory of change drawn after the plan, the logframe built for control, the arrows that don't survive the field, systems change in a two-year grant. The full essay — ten cited exchanges, commentary and footnotes — is published; the ten cartoon illustrations are pending (placeholder image paths under `/assets/images/the-theory-of-change/`). The series index now lists five essays.
- Registered all three in `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, the `data/data-notes.json` / `data/deep-dives.json` registries, and the Marginalia guide.

## v10.117.0 — July 12, 2026 (Fact-check audit — corrections across companions & a 101 deck)

### Fixed

- **Fact-check audit of the Reading Companions and 101 decks — 10 factual corrections.** A systematic review (automated known-error checks + a parallel deep review of every companion built this session) surfaced and fixed:
  - *MEL Basics (101)* — the Logical Framework was developed **for** USAID by Practical Concepts Inc. (1969), not "by USAID".
  - *Majoritarianism in India* — the *S.R. Bommai* case was a **nine-judge** bench (not seven).
  - *Indian Political Thought* — Har Dayal died in **1939** (not 1938).
  - *Realising Rights (Welfare Handbook)* — the RTE 25% reservation was upheld by the Supreme Court in **2012** (not 2013).
  - *Mahatma Gandhi: His Life & Times* — the 1906 satyagraha meeting was at Johannesburg's **Empire Theatre** (not "Imperial").
  - *Bhima Koregaon (Ajaz Ashraf)* — Stan Swamy was **84** at his death (not 83).
  - *Queering Digital India* — Mudasir Kamran was a student at **EFLU**, Hyderabad (not the University of Hyderabad).
  - *Hindutva and Violence (Savarkar)* — corrected a mislabel ("An Impossible History" is the book's Part IV / thesis, not its title).
  - *Python Cookbook* — the GIL is released roughly every **100** bytecodes (not ~10).
  - *A Primer for Spatial Econometrics* — corrected the model-nesting claim (SARAR nests SLM/SEM/OLS; the SLX/SDM-nesting model is the GNS).

## v10.116.0 — July 12, 2026 (Quality — final 3 companions rebuilt & a mislabelled one corrected)

### Changed

- **Three more Reading Companions rebuilt from the complete source text**, completing the full-fidelity pass: *Mahatma Gandhi: His Life & Times* (Louis Fischer, 1951), *Causality in Policy Studies* (Damonte & Negri, eds.), and the corrected *Wages for Housework in India?*.
- **Corrected a mislabelled companion.** The "Wages for Housework" companion had been built with the wrong book's details — it described a non-existent 6-chapter cash-transfers book by Prabha Kotiswaran (2026). Its actual source is a short 2021 essay, *Wages for Housework in India?* by Rohini Hensman; the companion, title, author and description are now corrected to match.

## v10.115.0 — July 12, 2026 (Quality — 10 companions rebuilt at full fidelity)

### Changed

- **Ten Reading Companions were rebuilt from the complete source text.** These had originally been generated from partial (truncated) extracts, so their later chapters were summarised from general knowledge rather than the book itself. They now cover every chapter faithfully, grounded in the actual text: *Introducing Python* (3rd ed.), *Python Cookbook*, *Machine Learning Systems*, *Introductory Statistics*, *Beginning Statistics*, *A Primer for Spatial Econometrics*, *Doing Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo*, *Health Inequality Monitoring* (WHO 2024), *The Open Handbook of Experience Sampling Methodology*, and *A Guide to Responsible Research*.

## v10.114.0 — July 12, 2026 (Fix — no more empty companion tabs)

### Fixed

- **Reading Companion tabs that had no content no longer show as blank pages.** A companion's "Pathways" tab (and occasionally "Toolkit" or "Context") is optional and was left empty for many books, but the tab still appeared and opened to an empty panel. Tabs now appear only when they have content, so every tab you can click has something in it.

## v10.113.0 — July 12, 2026 (New Reading Companion — Realising Rights)

### For Learners

- **Realising Rights: A Handbook of Welfare in India** (Centre for the Study of the Indian Economy, Azim Premji University, 2026) — a new interactive Reading Companion mapping India's major welfare laws and schemes across 18 chapters: from the constitutional Directive Principles through the rights-based era (food, work, education) to Direct Benefit Transfers and "New Welfarism" — covering ICDS, PM POSHAN, RTE, PDS/NFSA, MGNREGA, pensions, PM-KISAN, PMJAY, women's cash transfers, social accountability and the digital state.

## v10.112.0 — July 12, 2026 (4 new Reading Companions — 128 → 132)

### For Learners

- **Four new interactive Reading Companions**, each grounded in the full text:
  - **The Backstage of Democracy: India's Election Campaigns and the People Who Manage Them** (Amogh Dhar Sharma) — how professional campaign consultants and IT cells reshape Indian elections.
  - **Make Me a Man! Masculinity, Hinduism, and Nationalism in India** (Sikata Banerjee) — how nationalist movements construct gender and masculinity.
  - **The Many Lives of Syeda X: The Story of an Unknown Indian** (Neha Dixit) — thirty years and fifty jobs in the life of a Muslim woman informal worker, a window into women's home-based labour, migration and survival.
  - **Negotiating the Urban Margins** (Dhiren Swain) — slum-dweller committees and in-situ land titling in Odisha's basti settlements (JAGA Mission).

## v10.111.0 — July 12, 2026 (Fix — returning visitors now get the latest content)

### Fixed

- **Returning visitors were being served stale, cached copies of the site.** The offline cache version hadn't been rotated in six days, so recent updates (new reading companions, the new lab, the browse/search improvements) didn't appear for people whose browsers had cached the old assets. Bumping the service-worker version forces a clean cache refresh on next visit, so everyone now receives the current site.
- **This will no longer recur.** Each deploy now automatically stamps both the in-page refresh signal *and* the service-worker cache version (previously only the former), so the offline cache rotates on every release without anyone remembering to bump it by hand.

## v10.110.0 — July 12, 2026 (Fix — homepage tour)

### Fixed

- **The homepage guided tour no longer hangs.** The tour would stall on the "101 Course Decks" step — that item lives inside the Learn dropdown, and the tour wasn't actually expanding the menu, so Intro.js got stuck highlighting a hidden, zero-height element and the tour exited early. The tour now opens the dropdown properly (using the nav's own reveal mechanism) and runs through every step.

## v10.109.0 — July 12, 2026 (Reading Companions landing — search & pagination)

### For Learners

- **The Reading Companions library is easier to browse.** With 128 companions, the page now has an instant **search box** (find any companion by title, author or topic), shows results **24 at a time** with a **"Load more"** button instead of one endless scroll, and displays a live count of what you're seeing — all working together with the existing category filters.

## v10.108.0 — July 12, 2026 (New Lab — Before We Fall Apart)

### For Learners

- **Before We Fall Apart — a group conflict-preparedness studio.** A new interactive Lab and the capstone practicum for the *Nonviolence in Practice* flagship. Work through it with your collective, team or organisation to build the capacity to repair *before* you rupture: draft shared agreements, name each person's tripwires and the needs beneath them, agree a rupture-to-repair protocol in advance, map accountability pods, and export a shared relational charter. Everything stays in your browser.

### Changed

- Interactive Labs count updated across the site: 30 → 31. (Also corrected pre-existing filter-count drift on the Labs page.)

## v10.107.0 — July 12, 2026 (22 new Reading Companions — South Asian politics, history & society)

### For Learners

- **Twenty-two new interactive Reading Companions** on South Asian politics, history, religion, caste, gender and society — each grounded in the full text, with chapter navigation, key concepts, a practitioner toolkit and an AI Q&A:
  - **Shadows at Noon** (Joya Chatterji) and **India: 5,000 Years of History on the Subcontinent** (Audrey Truschke) — sweeping histories of the South Asian twentieth century and the subcontinent.
  - **Islam in South Asia** (Jamal Malik), **Jinnealogy** (Anand Vivek Taneja) and **Muslim Zion** (Faisal Devji) — histories of Islam, memory and the idea of Pakistan.
  - **Empire's Backyard** (Kailash C. Baral) — colonial modernity and Northeast India.
  - **Majoritarianism in India** (Javed Gaya), **Hindutva and Violence: V. D. Savarkar** (Vinayak Chaturvedi), **Fascism in India** (Luna Sabastian) and **Violent Fraternity** (Shruti Kapila) — the intellectual history and politics of majoritarianism.
  - **Prophets Facing Backward** (Meera Nanda), **Anti-Muslim Violence in India's Religious Ethnocracy** and **Bulldozer Justice** — science, religious nationalism, and punitive urban politics.
  - **The Limits of Tolerance** (C. S. Adcock) and **Meat-eating in India** (C. Sathyamala) — secularism, religious freedom and food politics.
  - **Panthers in Parliament** (Hugo Gorringe), **Bhima Koregaon: Challenging Caste** (Ajaz Ashraf) and **Rules for Radicals** (Saul Alinsky) — Dalit politics, caste and community organizing.
  - **Women in India: Exploring Work, Life, and Freedom** and **Queering Digital India** — gender, work and queer digital life.
  - **The Sea, Subalternity, and the Sundarbans** (Sneha Roy) — environmental anthropology of the delta.
  - **Encyclopedia of New Populism and Responses in the 21st Century** — a reference work on populism worldwide.

### Changed

- Reading Companions count updated across the site: 106 → 128.
- Refreshed the Reading Companions count (→128) in the Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi documentation.

## v10.106.0 — July 11, 2026 (3 new Labs + 5 new Handouts — filling the gaps)

### For Learners

- **Impact Evaluation Designer** — a new interactive lab to design a credible impact evaluation end to end: frame the question and estimand, choose an identification strategy (RCT, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, matching, synthetic control, interrupted time series) with its assumptions, size the sample and power you need, and work through validity threats. Pairs with the Causal Inference flagship. [/Labs/impact-evaluation-lab.html](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/impact-evaluation-lab.html)
- **NVC & Mediation Practice** — a new lab to practise Nonviolent Communication and restorative dialogue: build Observation-Feeling-Need-Request statements, use feelings & needs inventories, plan a restorative circle, and rehearse real conflict scenarios. Pairs with the Nonviolence in Practice flagship. [/Labs/nvc-mediation-lab.html](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/nvc-mediation-lab.html)
- **Livelihoods & Value-Chain** — a new lab to analyse a livelihood system and design what to do about it: map the sustainable-livelihoods capitals, build the value chain node by node, diagnose constraints and leverage points, and design interventions linked to real Indian programmes (NRLM, FPOs, PMKVY, MGNREGA). Pairs with the Livelihoods in India flagship. [/Labs/livelihoods-value-chain-lab.html](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/livelihoods-value-chain-lab.html)
- **Five new practitioner handouts** — Rights-Based Approach (RTI, PIL & legal empowerment), Measuring Social-Emotional Learning, AI for Evaluators (prompt patterns & guardrails), an SBCC Campaign Planner, and Institutional & Collective-Action Analysis. Each fills a thin handout track and reinforces a flagship course.

The Interactive Labs library is now **30** and the handout library is **89**.

## v10.105.0 — July 11, 2026 (Deep refresh: marketing kit, press kit, learner analytics)

### Changed

- **Content Marketing Kit + Press Kit refreshed to the 2026 platform.** Fixed stale counts throughout (games →135, labs →27, reading companions →105, Dataverse →296, ImpactLex →390+, libraries →12) and the press kit's internal contradiction (its Quick Facts said 62 courses / 16 flagship while its own offerings section said 69 / 17 — now consistently 69 / 17). Both now feature the genuinely-new offerings: Field Radio, Pro Studio, the single 8-tab MEL Lab, ₹350 Notes PDFs, Assessed Certificate Tracks, and Peer Review.
- **Learner Analytics dashboard deepened** (`/admin/learner-analytics.html`, admin-only). Added Engaged-Learners and Avg-Progress summary cards, a Learners-by-Plan-Tier breakdown, a Submissions-per-Week trend, and a Top-Courses-by-Enrollment table — all computed live from the database.

## v10.104.0 — July 11, 2026 (Data Notes — independent data investigations)

### For Learners

- **Data Notes** — a new kind of content: independent data investigations that take one public dataset, chart it, make an argument, and spell out what the numbers can't show. Browse them at [/DataNotes/](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/). Six to start, each with fancy interactive charts (that also work on your phone) and a plain-English "what this data can and can't tell you" guide:
  - [**The states that spend most on welfare have the least to show for it**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/state-welfare-budgets.html) — India's biggest social-sector spenders record its worst welfare outcomes (RBI state budgets).
  - [**The women dropping off the voter list**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/women-and-the-sir.html) — women deleted from the electoral rolls in far greater numbers than men.
  - [**Whose name is on the house?**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/whose-name-on-the-house.html) — the gap between the housing scheme's women-ownership mandate and who actually owns a home.
  - [**Paid an honorarium, not a wage**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/honorarium-not-a-wage.html) — the ~34 lakh women who run India's nutrition and health systems, paid below the wage floor.
  - [**The safety fund nobody spends**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/the-safety-fund-nobody-spends.html) — how the Nirbhaya Fund is "76% spent" and "a fifth spent" at the same time.
  - [**The pension that never got a raise**](https://www.impactmojo.in/DataNotes/the-pension-that-never-got-a-raise.html) — the ₹200 old-age pension, unchanged since 2006, worth a third of what it was.

## v10.103.0 — July 11, 2026 (One comprehensive MEL Lab)

### For Learners

- **The two MEL labs are now one.** The old **MEL Design Lab** and **MEL Plan Lab** overlapped and split a single workflow in half. They're merged into one [**MEL Lab**](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/mel-lab.html) with eight guided tabs across two phases — *Design* (framework, indicators, data collection, analysis) then *Plan* (project setup, indicator matrix, calendar & budget, reporting & learning). One progress bar, your work saved in the browser, and per-phase exports. Both old links 301-redirect, so nothing breaks.

### Changed

- Interactive Labs count updated from 28 to 27 across the site (the two MEL labs became one).

## v10.102.0 — July 11, 2026 (Impact page — the reach of free)

### For Learners

- **The Impact page now leads with the scale of what's free.** [/impact-dashboard](https://www.impactmojo.in/impact-dashboard.html) adds a "The reach of free" band up top — 69 free courses, 135 learning games, 84 handouts, 105 reading companions, 296 datasets, 12 open libraries — alongside the existing community-logged real-world outcomes. Two kinds of impact in one place: what's within reach, and what learners do with it.

## v10.101.0 — July 11, 2026 (Teach with Us — more ways to contribute)

### For Learners

- **Teach with Us now invites more than course authors.** [/contribute](https://www.impactmojo.in/contribute.html) (renamed from "Contribute a Course" to **"Teach with Us"**) now spells out six ways to contribute — a flagship course, a 101 course, a Deep Dive, an interactive lab, a reading companion, or a handout — each with what it is and the level of effort. The proposal form now asks which format you have in mind, so we can route your idea to the right editor.

## v10.100.0 — July 11, 2026 (Peer Review — see it in action)

### For Learners

- **Peer Review now shows what it's about before you sign in.** [/peer-review](https://www.impactmojo.in/peer-review.html) used to be a sign-in wall; it now opens with a "See peer review in action" showcase — three worked example submissions (an outcome indicator, a Theory-of-Change assumption test, a baseline sampling plan) each with model peer feedback and the three ratings (clarity, rigor, usefulness). Clearly marked as illustrative, it shows newcomers exactly what good looks like — and why reviewing others sharpens your own work — before they create a free account.

## v10.99.0 — July 11, 2026 (Pro Studio — one home for the tools)

### For Learners

- **Pro Studio** — a new home for ImpactMojo's professional tools at [/premium-tools](https://www.impactmojo.in/premium-tools/), grouped so it's finally clear what's what: **Pro Studio** builders (free to use, Premium only to export — research-question and ToR builders, logframe, empathy map, AI canvas, code converter, qualitative insights), **Free tools** (chart selector, DevData practice, viz cookbook, field notes), and **Premium** AI (AI Advisory Board, VaniScribe). Linked from the top nav and footer.

## v10.98.1 — July 11, 2026 (Admin hardening)

### Fixed

- **Admin tooling hardened.** `robots.txt` now disallows `/admin/` and `/ops/` (previously only one file was blocked), so internal tools stay out of search results. The internal Bug Tracker (`admin/bugs.html`) — the one admin page that had no access gate — now requires an admin sign-in before it renders, matching the rest of the admin surface.

## v10.98.0 — July 11, 2026 (Labs consolidation — no more duplicate tools)

### Changed

- **Retired 10 duplicate tool copies.** Several tools existed three times over — a rich interactive Lab, a thin "-pro" copy, and a bare template. Consolidated to one canonical home each: **Theory of Change, Stakeholder Mapping and Policy Analysis** now point to their comprehensive **Labs**; **Logframe, Empathy Map, AI Opportunity Canvas and Chart Selector** to their single tool. Old URLs 301-redirect, so no link breaks. (The premium/gated versions of these tools are unaffected — they run from a separate app.)

## v10.97.0 — July 11, 2026 (Cleaner navigation — Libraries, Specials, About)

### Changed

- **The Libraries hub is now libraries-only** — [/libraries](https://www.impactmojo.in/libraries.html) lists the 12 reference collections you browse and read (Reading Companions, Deep Dives, Handouts, Timelines, Marginalia, Research to Action, Dataverse, BCT Repository, ImpactLex, PolicyDhara, DevDiscourses, FieldCases). Courses, labs and games moved out — they have their own homes in the menu.
- **Tidier Specials menu** — the reading and reference-library items were removed from the Specials dropdown (they now live in the Libraries hub, which is one click away in the top nav), leaving Games, Practice & Programs, and Showcase.
- **Shorter About Us menu** — the 12-item About dropdown is regrouped into three tidy sections (About · Get Involved · More).

### Fixed

- **The Handouts gallery now shows every handout.** It was truncating each track to the first 10 files, leaving ~30 handouts unreachable (rendered as a non-clickable "+N more"). Now every handout is a clickable link, and the gallery has a committed static index (`data/handouts-index.json`) it falls back to if GitHub's API is rate-limited — so [/handouts](https://www.impactmojo.in/handouts.html) never renders empty.
- **Corrected stale/contradictory counts across the marketing surfaces.** A content-marketing graphic literally showed "9 Courses"; the press kit contradicted itself (62 vs 69 courses, 16 vs 18 flagship, 134 vs 135 games); the handouts page claimed "400+ resources." Standardised the public numbers to reality — **69 courses (18 flagship + 52 foundational), 135 games, 22 deep dives, 84 handouts, 12 AI study companions, 15 challenges** — across the homepage, press kit, content-marketing kit, handouts page, search index and the monthly-newsletter fallbacks. Also marked the site languages as "live" (they were still labelled "coming").

## v10.96.1 — July 11, 2026 (Field Radio — mobile polish + copy)

### Fixed

- **Field Radio is now properly mobile-friendly** — fixed a horizontal-overflow bug (long clip titles were forcing the page wider than the screen), so it fits phones cleanly: the transport controls wrap, the playlist flows with the page, tap targets are sized, and there's no sideways scroll.
- **Copy** — the station now reads "Voices from practitioners across South Asia"; internal community shorthand removed from the page, titles and metadata.

## v10.96.0 — July 11, 2026 (Field Radio — video shorts + universal MP3 audio)

### For Learners

- **Field Radio now has video, not just voice** — four video shorts join the station: **Varna welcoming the community and explaining what MEL really means**, plus talks on what makes a good indicator, building a learning culture, and baseline design. They play in a vertical frame and auto-advance alongside the voice notes. [Tune in](https://www.impactmojo.in/field-radio.html).
- **Plays everywhere now** — the voice notes were re-encoded to MP3, so they play reliably across all browsers, including iPhone/Safari.

## v10.95.0 — July 11, 2026 (Field Radio goes live — real voices + surfaced in nav)

### For Learners

- **Field Radio is live with real voices** — [/field-radio](https://www.impactmojo.in/field-radio.html) now streams 11 voice notes from the ImpactMojo Practitioner Learning Community: facilitator Vandana's weekly challenges and "Ask Me Anything" coaching on Theory of Change, indicators (SMART and CREAM), testing assumptions, and getting into the sector. Press play and it runs like a station; filter by learning track; every clip carries a transcript. (Video shorts follow shortly.)
- **Easier to find what's new** — the homepage top nav now surfaces the **Libraries** hub and **Field Radio**, and the footer links them too.

### Changed

- **Podcast retired in favour of Field Radio** — the placeholder "Podcast / Between the Logframes" links (which redirected away) are replaced site-wide by Field Radio.

## v10.94.0 — July 11, 2026 (Field Radio — scaffold)

### Added

- **Field Radio** (`/field-radio.html`) — a community "station" that plays PLC voice notes and shorts back-to-back (auto-advance), with a folk-art dial, cassette/vertical-video stage, learning-track filters and a transcript caption panel. Self-contained, brand-standard chrome, driven by `data/field-radio.json` (drop media into `/assets/field-radio/` and add an entry). Ships with placeholder sample tones so the dial works before real media is uploaded; not yet surfaced in nav or the Libraries hub, and no learner-facing announcement, pending real clips. Verified in headless Chromium: audio + (WebM) video both play and auto-advance, zero JS errors.

## v10.93.0 — July 11, 2026 (Roadmap blog, rewritten as a mid-year scorecard)

### For Learners

- **"What We've Shipped in 2026 (So Far)"** — the December 2025 roadmap post is now an honest mid-year scorecard: each promise marked live, in progress, or still ahead, plus the unplanned wins (the Libraries hub, searchable Site Map, Course Notes PDFs, the content refresh). [Read it](https://www.impactmojo.in/blog/whats-coming-in-2026.html).
- **Two interactive reading companions now carry the full site chrome** — the *History of Economic Thought* and *Beyond Developmentality* interactive companions now have the standard ImpactMojo top bar, language switcher, theme toggle and footer, matching every other companion in the library.

### Fixed

- **Brand consistency — the last gaps closed.** Added favicon links to the NVC-RJ and SEL flagship course indexes, the GA4 tag to the seven standalone `/templates/` tool pages, and wrapped the two remaining compiled book-companion bundles (History of Economic Thought, Beyond Developmentality) in the standard site shell — fixing their placeholder `<title>`s in the process. Every content and tool page on the platform now meets the brand pre-flight checklist.

## v10.92.0 — July 11, 2026 (Content audit — round 2 refresh)

A second data-refresh pass across the Deep Dives, a 101 deck and a landscape brief, bringing every headline figure to the latest published source.

### For Learners

- **Fresher numbers across the Deep Dives and 101 decks** — the health-systems, informality, learning-crisis, stunting and female-labour deep dives, the Child Development 101 deck, and the South Asia landscape brief now carry the latest published figures: NFHS-6 (2023–24) stunting and immunisation, NHA 2022–23 out-of-pocket spending, the WHO/World Bank 2025 UHC monitoring report, e-Shram registrations past 30 crore, post-pandemic learning poverty, the 2025 female LFPR, and updated South Asia growth projections.

## v10.91.0 — July 11, 2026 (The Libraries hub)

### For Learners

- **ImpactMojo Libraries** — a new single home for every collection on the platform, at [/libraries](https://www.impactmojo.in/libraries.html). Browse all 15 collections in one place — flagship courses, 101 decks, labs, games, reading companions, deep dives, handouts, premium tools, the Dataverse and the behaviour-change technique repository — grouped into Learn · Practice · Read · Data, each with a live count and a one-line description.

## v10.90.0 — July 10, 2026 (Content audit — round 1 fixes)

A page-by-page content audit (201 pages) surfaced a small set of real defects; this fixes them.

### Fixed

- **Homepage metadata reconciled** — the head carried three conflicting version strings and the JSON-LD course list declared 16 flagships but listed only 13 (while the copy said 17). Now a single version string and a complete 17-course structured-data list.
- **MCP-server blog post** — removed a duplicated footer/share/newsletter block that rendered the end of the article twice.
- **"Tools we use" blog post** — corrected a stale claim (said Formspree; the platform uses Netlify Forms).
- **"Data & Power in the Global South" deep dive** — fixed a citation that linked to the wrong book, and updated "Personal Data Protection Bill" to the enacted Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023).
- **"Why ImpactMojo exists" blog post** — removed stale "beta phase" framing.
- **"What's coming in 2026" blog post** — added a dated banner pointing to the current roadmap, since the original was written in Dec 2025 and its items have since shipped.

### Changed

- **Podcast unpublished** — the page was placeholder-only (no episodes, dead subscribe links). Removed its nav links site-wide, 301-redirected `/podcast.html` to the roadmap, and dropped it from the sitemap and search index.

## v10.89.0 — July 10, 2026 (Rebuilt Site Map)

### For Learners

- **A new, searchable Site Map** — [sitemap.html](https://www.impactmojo.in/sitemap.html) now lists every page on the platform (courses, 101 decks, labs, games, deep dives, practice packs, tools, credentials and more) in one filterable, theme-aware page. Type to filter 249 destinations; jump straight to any section.

### Changed

- Replaced the old static `sitemap.html` (84 links) with a filterable, brand-consistent map of 249 destinations across 15 sections, using the standard site chrome. The machine-readable `sitemap.xml` is unchanged.

## v10.88.0 — July 10, 2026 (Three new Assessed Tracks + a credential upgrade for free-pathway completers)

### For Learners

- **Three new Assessed Tracks (₹2,499 each), each capstone-reviewed with a verifiable credential** — **MEL** (the MEL flagship, the Theory of Change and MEL Planning labs, and the Donor Reporting pack), **Data & Technology** (Data Visualization and AI for Impact, plus the R & Python and Sampling Design labs) and **Policy & Economics** (Development Economics and Politics of Aspiration, the Policy Analysis lab and the Governance Evaluation pack). The courses themselves stay free to study online; the paid layer is the assessed capstone and the verified certificate. Find them on the [Products page](https://www.impactmojo.in/products.html#programs).
- **Verified Credential Upgrade (₹2,499)** — already worked through one of the five free credential pathways? Add just the assessed capstone and a verifiable credential for the pathway you completed, without re-buying content. Pick your pathway at checkout on the [upgrade page](https://www.impactmojo.in/credential-upgrade.html).

### Added

- Four new pages — `mel-assessed-certificate.html`, `data-tech-assessed-certificate.html`, `policy-economics-assessed-certificate.html` and `credential-upgrade.html` — templated from the AI-for-M&E track, reusing the existing UPI order → confirm flow (Netlify `certificate-track-order` form; the `product` field distinguishes each, and the upgrade page adds a `pathway` selector). Per-track UPI QR images added under `assets/images/`. Listed on `products.html`, `catalog.html`, `premium.html`, in `sitemap.xml` and the search index, and surfaced as cards in the Learning Pathways rail (`js/learning-pathways.js`). Assessed Tracks 1 → 4, plus the credential upgrade.

## v10.87.0 — July 10, 2026 (Flagship parity across all 17 — diagrams, readings, and printable Course Notes)

### For Learners

- **Every flagship module now opens a concept diagram** — a clean, theme-aware, hand-drawn-style figure that illuminates the module's core idea, across all 18 flagship courses and 224 modules.
- **Every flagship module now carries an open-access key reading** — a real, verified passage from a public-domain classic, a World Development Report, Our World in Data, a free textbook, a UN/agency document or an Indian Act, with a note on why it matters, opened from a button in the module.
- **Course Notes — printable PDF for every flagship (₹350).** Buy the complete notes for any of the 18 flagship courses as one print-ready PDF you own — every module's core ideas, diagrams, worked examples and key readings, laid out to annotate and work through offline. The courses themselves stay free to study online. Find them on the [Products page](https://www.impactmojo.in/products.html#course-notes) or from the "Course Notes" button on each course.
- **AI for Impact** refreshed for 2026 — the NLP module now covers how large language models have reshaped qualitative coding and summarisation since 2023, alongside the classical methods, with the data-governance caveats spelled out.
- **Four new 101 courses** — free, self-paced interactive slide decks: **GenAI for Practitioners** (using LLMs responsibly in development work), **Data Protection & the DPDP Act** (India's 2023 data-protection law for NGOs), **Safeguarding & PSEA** (protection from sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment), and **Disability Inclusion** (rights-based, twin-track inclusion). The foundational library grows from 47 to 51 courses.

### Added

- Four native-HTML 101 decks at `/101-courses/{genai-practitioners,data-protection-dpdp,safeguarding-psea,disability-inclusion}.html` (37–40 slides each), listed on the 101 index, in `catalog_data.json`, `sitemap.xml` and the search index. Foundational count 47 → 51; total courses 64 → 68.
- 17 new products at `/products/notes-<course>/` — one printable Course-Notes PDF per flagship, generated from the live course content, delivered on manual-UPI confirmation via the existing order → confirm → signed-download flow (files in the private `products` bucket; titles wired into `submission-created.mjs`). Listed on `products.html`, in `sitemap.xml` and the search index.

### Changed

- Content-freshness pass across all 18 flagships: time-sensitive figures year-stamped for durability (OBC/EWS ceiling, education-spend target) where they were stated as bare "currently".
- Architecture cleanup (anti-fork): all 18 flagship courses are now served exclusively from the database. Removed the last in-repo course content — `supabase/seed-content/` and the five stale seed migrations (causal, intervention, livelihoods, nvc-rj, powerBI) — so no flagship module content lives in the repository. Course shells and the `course_content` table schema are unchanged; content is edited directly in the DB.

## v10.86.0 — July 9, 2026 (Flagship parity — deeper NVC & Intervention modules)

### For Learners

- **Nonviolence in Practice** modules are now much deeper — every module carries a fully worked example, a hand-drawn concept diagram, richer definitions, and a reflection prompt to close on, with case scenarios grounded in South Asian settings.
- **Designing What Works** modules gain a clear concept diagram each (problem trees, results chains, the delivery-chain cascade, the targeting-error matrix, the PDIA loop) and worked formulae where the design question is quantitative — value actually received from a transfer, last-mile coverage, chain completion, and cost per outcome.

### Added

- New reference: `docs/flagship-course-standard.md` — the canonical spec for what makes a course a flagship (design system, component catalog, and a per-course parity checklist), used to audit and level up courses.
- Theme-aware inline-SVG diagrams (recolour with light/dark) across all 14 Intervention and 12 NVC-RJ modules; KaTeX formulae added to the quantitative Intervention modules.

### Changed

- NVC-RJ module content roughly tripled in depth (seed migration `20260709_seed_nvc_rj_content.sql` regenerated); the coaching call-to-action is now used sparingly (about one module in three) rather than on every module.
- Intervention module content extended additively (seed migration `20260708_seed_intervention_content.sql` regenerated); existing prose and worked examples untouched.

### Fixed

- NVC-RJ course page: the background blobs and reading-progress bar had styles but no markup, so neither rendered — both are now instantiated.

## v10.85.0 — July 9, 2026 (New flagship — Nonviolence in Practice)

### For Learners

- **Nonviolence in Practice: Communication, Resistance & Repair** — a new flagship on three canonical traditions of applied nonviolence, taught at depth: **Nonviolent Communication** (Marshall Rosenberg), **Non-Violent Resistance / New Authority** (Haim Omer), and **Restorative Justice** (Howard Zehr and the circle traditions). It traces their indigenous and South Asian roots (panchayat justice, gram nyayalayas, ubuntu, Navajo peacemaking), takes the feminist and decolonial critiques seriously, and ends in facilitation fieldcraft and a capstone. 11 modules plus capstone, a 48-term interactive lexicon, and an "Assess Yourself" self-check.

### Added

- New flagship course at `/courses/nvc-rj/` — a native HTML shell whose 11 modules are served from Supabase (`course_content`, seed migration `20260709_seed_nvc_rj_content.sql`), matching the platform's fork-protection model. Includes a companion `lexicon.html` (48 terms across NVC, NVR and Restorative Justice), an inline orientation, capstone and "Assess Yourself" self-check.
- Cross-linked with the Gandhi and Social-Emotional Learning flagships and the Conflict-Sensitive Programming Lab.
- Flagship count updated across the site: 16 → 17.

## v10.84.0 — July 8, 2026 (New flagship — Designing What Works)

### For Learners

- **Designing What Works: Development Interventions from Model to Scale** — a new 14-module flagship on the craft of intervention and programme design: the models proven at population scale (the graduation approach, cash transfers, community health workers, self-help groups, teaching at the right level), the design principles behind them, and how to think about scale. Grounded in South Asian delivery systems — NRLM, ASHA, DBT, Pratham and BRAC — with an interactive lexicon and an "Assess Yourself" self-check.

### Added

- New flagship course at `/courses/intervention/` with a native HTML shell and 14 modules served from Supabase (`course_content`, seed migration `20260708_seed_intervention_content.sql`).
- New **Practice & Design** track on the flagship courses page.
- Flagship count updated across the site: 15 → 16.

## v10.83.8 — July 8, 2026 (Join the PLC via form)

### Changed

- Joining the **Professional Learning Community** now goes through a short application form instead of an open WhatsApp group link — so the community stays a curated space for development practitioners. The "Request to Join" buttons across the homepage, community page, premium, account and updates pages all point to the form.

## v10.83.7 — July 8, 2026 (Book Companions renamed to Reading Companions)

### Changed

- The **Book Companions** section is now **Reading Companions** — the collection includes journal articles, essays, chapters and reports, not only books, so the label was broadened across the site (hero, navigation, catalogue filter, premium, docs, search). URLs and filenames are unchanged. Pre-baked the new label in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi.

## v10.83.6 — July 8, 2026 (Real State of the Economy companion + translated-doc counts)

### Added

- **Real State of the Economy 2026** book companion — a reading companion to the AICC (Indian National Congress) research wing's economic counter-report, presented transparently as an opposition-party primary source to be read alongside official data.

### Changed

- Book Companions count updated across the site: 105 → 106.
- Refreshed the Book Companions count (→106) in the Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi documentation.

## v10.83.5 — July 8, 2026 (2 new companions — digital rights & AI literacy)

### For Learners

- **How Image AI Works** — a plain-language explainer of how vision/image AI models actually work (patches, embeddings, CLIP, diffusion, multimodal LLMs), with every concept translated into social-sector use cases and risks.

### Changed

## v10.83.4 — July 8, 2026 (5 new companions — care economy, statistics, education & Gandhi)

### For Learners

## v10.82.4 — July 7, 2026 (VaniScribe field transcription, now freemium & on-site)

### For Learners

- **VaniScribe — free AI transcription for field research.** Transcribe interviews, FGDs, and field recordings in 22 Indian languages right in your browser, including code-mixed Hindi-English speech. It's free to use — you bring your own Sarvam AI key (every new account gets ₹1,000 in free credits, ~33 hours of audio) and your key never leaves your device. Export to TXT, CSV, or JSON. For heavier fieldwork, a Premium companion notebook adds speaker labelling (who said what) and long-file batch processing.

### Changed

- VaniScribe now runs directly on impactmojo.in (under `/premium-tools/`) instead of a separate external site, and moved to a freemium model: the browser transcriber is free for everyone, while the advanced Colab batch notebook (speaker diarization, 60-minute files, 20-file batches) is a Professional-tier feature.

## v10.82.3 — July 7, 2026 (DevData Practice & Visualization Cookbook now on-site)

### Changed

- **DevData Practice** and the **Visualization Cookbook** are now served directly from impactmojo.in (under `/premium-tools/`) instead of a separate external site, so they open in the same session as the rest of Pro Studio and no longer bounce through a separate sign-in wall. DevData Practice documents 36 open-source dataset generators (840k+ rows modelled on DHS / NFHS / ASER frameworks); the Visualization Cookbook covers 14 chart types with ready-to-run R, Python, and Excel code.

## v10.82.2 — July 6, 2026 (Course self-assessments)

### For Learners

- **Check what you've learned — every flagship now ends with a self-check.** All 15 flagship courses now finish with a six-question auto-graded self-assessment (90 questions in all), each grounded in that course's own material. Pick an answer, see instantly whether it's right, and read a short explanation of the reasoning. No sign-in, nothing stored. (This also fixes the "Assess Yourself" links on Data Visualization and AI for M&E, which previously led nowhere.)

## v10.82.1 — July 6, 2026 (AI Agents module ships early)

### For Learners

- **AI Agents for Evaluators is live now — a month early.** The Certificate Track's newest module teaches you to build no-code AI assistants for real M&E work: five agent patterns, two step-by-step build walkthroughs with copy-paste prompts, the ethics rules that keep you safe, and a capstone you can put in your portfolio. Free to read.
- **Two new programmes are now easy to find everywhere** — Build Circles (four-week AI build cohorts where demoing wins your deposit back) and the AI for M&E Certificate Track are in the catalogue, the homepage menu, and the products page.

## v10.82.0 — July 6, 2026 (Build Circles & the AI for M&E Certificate Track)

### For Learners

- **Build Circles — four-week AI build cohorts.** Pick a real M&E problem, build a working AI workflow with a small cohort on a weekly rhythm, and demo it on Demo Day. Free waitlist; the ₹1,000 seat deposit comes back to you when you demo, along with a verified certificate.
- **AI for M&E Certificate Track (₹2,499).** Self-paced and assessed: a guided path through the AI for Impact course, the Counterfactual game, the full Critiquing Evidence practice pack, a real-work capstone with written feedback, and a verifiable certificate.

## v10.81.1 — July 6, 2026 (New blog post: The Counterfactual Habit)

### For Learners

- **[What Would Have Happened Anyway? The Counterfactual Habit](https://www.impactmojo.in/blog/counterfactual-habit.html)** — a new plain-language blog post on the single most useful habit in impact evaluation: asking "compared to what would have happened anyway?" Learn the four traps that fool boards and funders — regression to the mean, self-selection, survivorship, and confounding shocks — the ladder of honest evaluation designs, and three questions to ask of any impact claim. No statistics background needed; pairs with the Counterfactual game and the Causal Inference course.

## v10.81.0 — July 6, 2026 (Smoother theme switching, faster homepage)

### Fixed

- Every blog post now has the same three-way theme control (System / Light / Dark) as the rest of the site, and your choice sticks across pages and visits. The /courses and /games web addresses now take you straight to the course gallery and the Game Library.

## v10.80.2 — July 6, 2026 (New Deep Dive: Platform & Gig Work in India)

### For Learners

- **[Platform & Gig Work in India](https://www.impactmojo.in/DeepDives/platform-gig-work-india.html)** — a new Deep Dive with 26 annotated readings on India's gig economy: how big it really is, what the work feels like for drivers, delivery partners and beauty workers, the new laws (Rajasthan's 2023 Act, the Social Security Code), the global debate, and how gig workers are organising. The 21st Deep Dive — pairs with the Livelihoods course and the Gender & Work timeline.
- **All 15 flagship courses can now be downloaded for offline use** — six more courses (Gender, Public Choice, Public Policy, Causal Inference, Livelihoods, Power BI) joined the offline download list, so every flagship works without a connection once saved.

### Fixed

- Three blog posts had hidden, unusable menu buttons — now cleaned up; the theme toggle on those pages works again. The sidebar collapse button on the SEL, Gender, and AI courses now works on desktop.

## v10.80.0 — July 5, 2026 (Counterfactual game, 15 Live Case Challenges, 6th timeline)

### For Learners

- **[Counterfactual: The Evaluation Game](https://www.impactmojo.in/Games/counterfactual-game.html)** — a new 10-minute game where you face eight real-world impact claims and pick the evaluation design that answers "what would have happened anyway?" Learn to dodge the eight classic traps that fool funders and boards — no statistics background needed.
- **Six new Live Case Challenges — every flagship course now has one.** Stress-test an impact claim, spec a Power BI dashboard from messy data, design a graduation pathway for ultra-poor households, diagnose why textbook procurement keeps failing, manage a donor exit in Nepal, and draft a policy memo before a political window closes. That's 15 real-world challenges, one per flagship course.
- **[Gender & Work in India, 1931–Today](https://www.impactmojo.in/timelines/gender-work-india.html)** — a new visual timeline of 18 landmark moments in how Indian women's work has been promised, protected, erased, counted, and contested — from the Karachi Resolution to SEWA, MGNREGA, the POSH Act, and today's care-economy debates. The sixth timeline in the collection.
- **[R & Python for Development](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/r-python-dev.html) — the full live-code course is here.** All seven modules now teach R and Python from absolute zero for development data work — wrangling, visualisation, and impact evaluation with real NFHS, ASER, PLFS and Budget data — with every line of code running live in your browser. Nothing to install.
- **Twelve new Interactive Labs** — the labs collection has grown to 27 hands-on workbenches, now covering budget and fiscal analysis, climate risk and adaptation, conflict-sensitive programming, data feminism, digital public infrastructure, research ethics, grant writing, participatory methods, policy brief writing, stakeholder mapping, survey design, and systems thinking.

### Fixed

- **26 blog posts and 4 book companions are now findable in site search** — the entire Learning Loops back-catalogue (theory-of-change pitfalls, sample size, participatory MEL, quasi-experimental designs, and more) plus the Health Economics, Unlimited Memory, Public Health Equity & Ethics, and Python econometrics companions.

## v10.79.33 — July 1, 2026 (R & Python live-code course — early access)

### Added

- **[R & Python for Development](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/r-python-dev.html)** — a new interactive course that teaches R and Python from absolute zero for development data work, with real code running live in the browser via WebR and Pyodide (no installation). Early access: Module 1 is live; Modules 2–7 (real NFHS/ASER/PLFS/Budget data, wrangling, visualisation, impact evaluation) are in progress. (Not yet announced in the learner newsletter until the full course ships.)

## v10.79.32 — July 1, 2026 (Eleven new Interactive Labs)

The Interactive Labs collection grows from 16 to 27, with three new tracks — Research & Methods, Governance & Digital, and Climate & Environment.

### For Learners

- **[Conflict-Sensitive Programming Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/conflict-sensitive-lab.html)** — apply Do No Harm principles, analyse conflict actors and drivers, and practise adapt/suspend/exit decisions for fragile settings.
- **[Data Feminism & Intersectional Analysis Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/data-feminism-lab.html)** — analyse data through gender, caste and power: disaggregate, spot bias across the data lifecycle, and visualise intersectionally.
- **[Digital Public Infrastructure Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/dpi-lab.html)** — understand India's DPI stack (Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker, ABHA, ONDC) and the DPDP Act 2023, and design programmes with ethical fallbacks.
- **[Ethics & Research Integrity Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/ethics-research-lab.html)** — navigate consent, data privacy, positionality, ethics review, and real fieldwork dilemmas to protect your participants.
- **[Grant Writing & Proposal Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/grant-writing-lab.html)** — match donors, build a theory of change, write compelling narratives, and budget credibly for fundable proposals.
- **[Participatory Methods Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/participatory-methods-lab.html)** — master participatory rural appraisal, community mapping, focus-group facilitation, and participatory M&E.
- **[Policy Brief Writing Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/policy-brief-lab.html)** — distil research into two-page briefs that move ministers, bureaucrats and media, with audience targeting and structure.
- **[Stakeholder Mapping & Power Analysis Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/stakeholder-mapping-lab.html)** — map actors, interests and influence on a power–interest grid to design smarter interventions and coalitions.
- **[Survey Design Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/survey-design-lab.html)** — craft survey instruments that measure what they claim: question wording, scales, bias tests, translation and piloting.
- **[Systems Thinking & Complexity Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/systems-thinking-lab.html)** — map systems, build causal loop diagrams, use the iceberg model and leverage points, and manage adaptively.

## v10.79.31 — July 1, 2026 (New Budget & Fiscal Analysis Lab)

### For Learners

- **[Budget & Fiscal Analysis Lab](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/budget-fiscal-lab.html)** — a new hands-on lab that teaches you to read Union and State budgets like a practitioner: decode BE/RE/actuals, trace fund flows from Centre to beneficiary, calculate per-capita spends with an interactive calculator, and understand fiscal federalism and Finance Commission devolution. The first of several new labs being added to the collection.

## v10.79.30 — July 1, 2026 (Free Tools section on the homepage)

### For Learners

- **New "Free Tools" section on the homepage** — the practitioner tools that are free to use (Sampling Toolkit, Research Question Builder, ToR Builder, Qualitative Insights Lab, Statistical Code Converter) now have their own clearly-labelled home, instead of sitting under "Premium Offerings." They've been removed from the premium showcase so nothing is double-listed.

## v10.79.29 — July 1, 2026 (Homepage + Premium page reflect the free tools)

### Fixed

- **The homepage no longer locks the now-free tools.** The Research Question Builder, Qualitative Insights Lab and Statistical Code Converter cards were still gated (a free user couldn't click through). They're now open, retitled without "Pro", and badged **Free**.
- **The Premium page now describes the freemium model** — the Explorer (free) tier lists the five free-to-use pro tools, the hero and FAQ say plainly that these tools are free to use with only export behind Premium, and the paid tiers now read "export from …" rather than implying the whole tool is paywalled.

## v10.79.28 — July 1, 2026 (One Sampling Toolkit front door)

### For Learners

- **New [Sampling Toolkit](https://www.impactmojo.in/labs/sampling-toolkit.html) hub** — a single front door (also at **impactmojo.in/sampling**) that presents the free Sampling Basics primer (Level 1) and the Sampling Design Studio (Level 2) as a clear "learn it, then design it" path, with a short "which do I need?" guide. The navigation now shows one **Sampling Toolkit** entry instead of two separate links.

## v10.79.27 — July 1, 2026 (Three more pro tools now free to use)

### For Learners

- **The ToR Builder, Qualitative Insights Lab and Statistical Code Converter are now free for everyone to use** — write a full Terms of Reference, code and analyse qualitative transcripts, or translate statistical code between R/Stata/SPSS/Python, all without a login. Exporting your work (copy, download, print) is the one Premium touch. That's four pro tools now on the free-to-use, premium-to-export model.
- *(The AI Advisory Board stays Premium — it runs live AI for every session.)*

## v10.79.26 — July 1, 2026 (Research Question Builder now free to use)

### For Learners

- **The [Research Question Builder](https://www.impactmojo.in/premium-tools/rq-builder.html) is now free for everyone.** Move from a vague idea to a testable, fundable research question with the PICO and SPIDER frameworks, a quality checklist and method suggestions — no login needed. Exporting your finished question (copy or download) is the one Premium touch. It's the first of the pro tools moving to this free-to-use, premium-to-export model.
- **One canonical sampling tool** — the old standalone Sample Size Calculator now redirects into the Sampling Design Studio, which does everything it did and more.

## v10.79.25 — July 1, 2026 (Sampling Studio: optimiser, validation, defend-note)

### For Learners

- **The [Sampling Design Studio](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/sampling-design-lab.html) gained three pro touches.** A **cluster cost optimiser** works out the most budget-efficient number of people per cluster from your travel and interview costs (free). A **validation panel** shows our engine reproducing standard textbook sample sizes — so you can check the maths, not just trust it (free). And **"Defend this number"** exports a donor/IRB-ready one-page justification — purpose, required sample, assumptions, formula and reviewer notes (Premium, like the other exports).

## v10.79.24 — July 1, 2026 (Sampling toolkit: nav tidy-up + freemium)

### Changed

- **Moved the two sampling tools into the Specials → Practice & Programs menu** (out of the Learn dropdown), where the Sampling Basics primer and Sampling Design Studio now sit together as a toolkit.
- **The Sampling Design Studio is now freemium** — designing your sampling strategy and seeing every sample size stays completely free; exporting/printing the sampling plan and the facilitator mode are Premium features. The Sampling Basics primer remains fully free.

## v10.79.23 — July 1, 2026 (Sampling Basics — a beginner's primer)

### For Learners

- **New [Sampling Basics primer](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/sampling-basics-lab.html)** — a free, no-maths, ten-minute grounding in the ideas behind sampling: why we don't measure everyone, what makes a sample representative (with a live convenience-vs-random demo), margin of error and confidence (with a sample-size slider you can feel), clusters, and describing vs comparing — plus a plain-language glossary. It's the gentle **Level 1** that leads into the Sampling Design Studio, so people meeting sampling for the first time aren't dropped in at the deep end. The 15th ImpactMojo Lab.

## v10.79.22 — July 1, 2026 (Sampling Design Studio — ICC library + two-level precision)

### For Learners

- **The [Sampling Design Studio](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/sampling-design-lab.html) now guesses less and defends more** — a built-in **ICC reference library** lets you pick a defensible intra-cluster-correlation by outcome (learning, immunisation, nutrition, WASH, income, empowerment and more) with the published range shown, instead of inventing the number that most affects a clustered sample size. The precision step is now split into two clear layers — **statistical rigor** (the sample you'd need in a perfect world) and **field reality** (clustering and non-response) — and every result shows both, so you can see exactly how much the field inflates your ideal sample.

## v10.79.21 — July 1, 2026 (Sampling Design Studio)

### For Learners

- **New [Sampling Design Studio](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/sampling-design-lab.html)** — a free, guided lab that walks you from your evaluation question to a defensible sampling strategy (simple random, stratified, cluster or multistage), sizes each stakeholder group with the maths done properly (design effect, finite-population correction, power and minimum detectable effect, non-response buffers), explains the statistics as you go, and hands you a printable sampling plan. Includes a facilitator mode for trainers. The 14th ImpactMojo Lab.

## v10.79.20 — July 1, 2026 (Game Library menu fix)

### Fixed

- **Game Library menu categories now filter correctly** — the category links under Platform → Game Library (Policy & Economics, MEL & Research, Gender & Equity, and the rest) each open the Game Library pre-filtered to that track instead of all landing on the same page. The Game Library page now reads `?track=` and `?type=` deep links.
- **Corrected the Game Library breakdown** — the "134 games" it describes are 17 interactive simulations plus **117** puzzles (not 134); fixed the miscount on the homepage, Premium page, press kit and README.

## v10.79.19 — June 25, 2026 (Telugu translation added)

### For Learners

- **The site now reads in Telugu (తెలుగు)** — pick Telugu from the language switcher to translate the interface and the 101 course pages, joining Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi. Brand names, tools and key terms are kept intact.

## v10.79.18 — June 24, 2026 (Live Workshops & community course contributions)

### For Learners

- **New [Live Workshops & Events](https://www.impactmojo.in/events.html)** — free live online sessions you can register for, add straight to your calendar, and join on the day (Theory of Change clinics, sample size, gender-responsive MEL and more).
- **[Teach with ImpactMojo](https://www.impactmojo.in/contribute.html)** — practitioners and researchers can now propose a course to publish free under CC BY-NC-ND, with full author credit and editorial support.

## v10.79.17 — June 24, 2026 (Impact Dashboard, on-brand Research-to-Action, unified nav)

### For Learners

- **New [Impact Dashboard](https://www.impactmojo.in/impact-dashboard.html)** — log the real-world outcomes of applying what you learned (policy changes, programmes improved, people reached) and see the aggregate community impact. The community view is open to everyone; logging your own outcomes needs a free sign-in.
- **The [Research to Action](https://www.impactmojo.in/research-to-action/) page now matches the rest of the site** — ImpactMojo display fonts, a gradient hero and floating paper-plane decorations.
- **Cleaner, more consistent icons and navigation** — fixed broken icons across ~30 pages and brought the last few pages onto the standard top bar.

## v10.79.16 — June 24, 2026 (Premium tools live & properly gated; flagship gallery complete)

### For Learners

- **The premium tools are now live and correctly access-controlled** — VaniScribe, DevData Practice, the Visualization Cookbook and the DevEconomics Toolkit are no longer "coming soon"; they open for subscribers and are now genuinely members-only (signed-out or non-subscriber visitors can't reach them, even with a direct link).
- **The [Flagship Courses gallery](https://www.impactmojo.in/courses/) now shows all 15 courses** — Power BI for Practitioners was missing and has been added.
- **One Theory of Change Workbench** — the duplicate standalone page now redirects to the canonical lab, so there's a single ToC builder.
- **The [Catalog](https://www.impactmojo.in/catalog.html) is now a true master index** — it now also lists the free Tools & Features (Game Library, Peer Review, certificate verification, Partner API), interactive Timelines, Practice Packs and Dojos, with matching filters. Hero counts corrected to 62 courses · 13 labs · 134 games · 11 premium.

## v10.79.15 — June 24, 2026 (Roadmap build-out: peer review, certificate verification, partner API + nav/sitemap fixes)

### For Learners

- **New [Flagship Courses gallery](https://www.impactmojo.in/courses/)** — one beautiful landing page for all 14 in-depth flagship courses (190 modules in total), with filters by theme and an expandable outline for every course, mirroring the 101-deck gallery.
- **New [Interactive Labs gallery](https://www.impactmojo.in/Labs/)** — a single browsable landing for all 13 hands-on labs (Theory of Change, MEL design, policy analysis, storytelling and more), with theme filters.
- **The [101 course gallery](https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/) is now in the main menu** — "Courses" in the Learn menu goes straight to the 47-deck gallery, and a new "Flagship Courses" entry opens the new flagship gallery. (Previously neither gallery was linked in navigation; "Courses" opened a pop-up that has now been retired in favour of the two galleries and the catalog.)
- **[Peer Review](https://www.impactmojo.in/peer-review.html)** — review other learners' assignments and case analyses with a simple clarity/rigour/usefulness rubric, and see the feedback others leave on your own submissions.
- **[Verify a certificate](https://www.impactmojo.in/verify.html)** — a fast, public portal where employers and recruiters can confirm an ImpactMojo certificate (or its Open Badge) by ID or link, no account needed.
- **[Partner API](https://www.impactmojo.in/api-docs.html)** — a free, read-only API and docs page so organisations can pull the ImpactMojo course, game and content catalogue into their own systems.

### Fixed

- **Mobile menu no longer cuts off** — the slide-out navigation now sizes to the visible screen (dynamic viewport height), so the theme toggle and every item are reachable on phones.
- **Power BI flagship link** now resolves to the live course instead of a dead URL.
- Retired the Courses, Labs and Games pop-ups in the menu and footer in favour of the new galleries (`/courses/`, `/Labs/`, `/game-library`).

## v10.79.14 — June 24, 2026 (All 16 book companions rebuilt + accessibility fix)

### For Learners

- **Every [book companion](https://www.impactmojo.in/BookSummaries/) now has the same clean reading experience** — light/dark theme, in-page translation, section navigation, key concepts, a practitioner toolkit with reflection prompts, and an Ask-the-book Q&A. The last 13 companions have been rebuilt to match, covering field experiments in economics, learning policy, health financing (*Paying for Health*), public-health equity & ethics, statistics with R, Python econometrics, small-sample-size methods, research design workflow, social norms & behaviour change, the circular economy, public innovation, public speaking, and memory technique.
- **Catalog deck cards are easier to read** — the course-detail line on each card now meets accessibility contrast standards.

## v10.79.13 — June 24, 2026 (Course-outline posters for every 101 deck)

### For Learners

- **Every [101 course deck](https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/) now has a course-outline poster** — a shareable one-page summary showing the full module breakdown, slide and module counts, and what's inside, before you open the 100-slide deck. Reach it from the new "Outline" link on any deck card.

## v10.79.12 — June 24, 2026 (Marginalia essay 4 + 101 practice workbooks)

### For Learners

- **New Marginalia cartoon essay — [The Beneficiary Is Not a Job Title](https://www.impactmojo.in/specials/the-beneficiary-is-not-a-job-title/)** — ten drawings where the development sector's vocabulary (sensitised, hard-to-reach, vulnerable, captured, amplified, people-centred) is answered by the person it's used about, each footnoted with real evidence (Freire, Chambers, Arnstein, Spivak, Kabeer, Longwe, Oxfam, and more).
- **Practice Workbooks for the 101 courses** — many [101 course decks](https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/) now have a companion practice workbook that turns each section into a concrete "Apply it" task and a reflection prompt, with notes saved in your browser. Live for MEL, Theory of Change, Impact Evaluation, Survey Design, Econometrics, Gender, and more — rolling out across all 47.

## v10.79.11 — June 23, 2026 (101 deck gallery + companion rebuild + mobile fixes)

### For Learners

- **The [101 course gallery](https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/) now shows what's actually inside each course** — the real slide count plus whether it includes a quiz, glossary, interactive charts, and further reading. You can filter the gallery by those features, and the slide counts are now accurate per deck (100+ slides each; 4,700+ in total).
- **Measuring Empowerment book companion rebuilt** — the [companion to the BMGF "What Gets Measured Matters" methods note](https://www.impactmojo.in/BookSummaries/measuring-empowerment-companion.html) now has the same reading experience as the rest of the library: light/dark theme, in-page translation, section navigation, and an Ask-the-book Q&A.
- **Mobile tidy-up on the homepage** — the accessibility button no longer covers the headline, and the language switcher sits clear of the other on-screen buttons.

## v10.79.10 — June 23, 2026 (Research to Action — Series 5, 6 & 7)

### For Learners

- **Three new poster sets on the [Research to Action](https://www.impactmojo.in/research-to-action/) page** — *Climate, Health & Resilience* (Series 5), *Home Truths* on how development work really plays out (Series 6), and *Policy & Programme Design* (Series 7). That's 30 more posters, bringing the album to seven series. Switch between them at the top of the album.

## v10.79.9 — June 23, 2026 (Research to Action — Series 4)

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Research Methods Without Panic" (Series 4)** on the [Research to Action](https://www.impactmojo.in/research-to-action/) page: ten posters that demystify core research methods — sampling, sample size, survey design, validity, reliability, qualitative interviews, focus groups, coding qualitative data, mixed methods, and research ethics. Switch series at the top of the album.

## v10.79.8 — June 23, 2026 (Research to Action — Series 3)

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Evaluation in Practice" (Series 3)** on the [Research to Action](https://www.impactmojo.in/research-to-action/) page: ten posters on doing evaluation well — theory of change, evaluation questions, process and outcome evaluation, contribution analysis, equity-focused and realist evaluation, implementation failure, rapid evaluation, and reporting that gets used. Switch series at the top of the album.

## v10.79.7 — June 23, 2026 (Research to Action — Series 2)

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Data to Decisions" (Series 2)** on the [Research to Action](https://www.impactmojo.in/research-to-action/) page: ten posters on turning data into good decisions — data quality, triangulation, monitoring, dashboards, administrative data, ethics, inclusive evidence, learning loops, qualitative data, and storytelling. Use the switcher at the top of the album to move between Series 1 and Series 2.

## v10.79.6 — June 23, 2026 (Research to Action poster series)

### For Learners

- **New "Research to Action" poster series** — a visual walk through turning research into decisions and impact: asking the right question, choosing a design, sample size, indicators, bias, correlation vs causation, reading findings, and communicating so people actually use the evidence. Browse the spotlight album, open any poster full-size, or download them for your own workshops and classrooms. **Series 1 — 10 posters.**

## v10.79.5 — June 19, 2026 (Push notifications)

### For Learners

- **Get reminders even when the tab is closed** — turn on browser push notifications from your account page (Notifications section) to get a nudge when your learning streak is about to lapse or a cohort deadline is near. It's per-device and fully optional — flip it off any time.

## v10.79.4 — June 19, 2026 (Offline support restored)

### For Learners

- **The site works offline again** — install ImpactMojo to your home screen and downloaded flagship courses stay readable without a connection. Pages always load the latest version when you're online (no more stale content), and your course progress now syncs automatically once you're back on the network.

## v10.79.3 — June 19, 2026 (Climate Action game light theme)

### For Learners

- **The Climate Action Challenge game now has a proper light mode** — warm, readable sand-and-brown colours that match the rest of the site, instead of the previous washed-out inverted look. Use the system/light/dark toggle in the top bar. It was the last game without a hand-designed light theme.

## v10.79.2 — June 16, 2026 (Translation quality — deep audit, three review rounds)

### Fixed

- Completed a full multilingual audit of the Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi course pages — **~870 strings corrected across three native-review rounds**. Beyond the first pass, the deeper rounds fixed: translated brand names (ImpactMojo, Tableau, Flourish, Econometrica), author surnames turned into common words ("North"→direction, "Black"→colour, "King"→monarch), mangled numbers ("700 million"→"700 crore", "8M+"→"8 minutes"), garbled acronyms (MEAL→"food", M&E→"graph", EPW→"death penalty"), reversed meanings ("decolonial"→"colonialist", "reforestation"→"deforestation", "Latest data"→"data not yet available"), wrong-sense terms ("Cases"→patients, "Causal"→"trickery", "stakes"→"claims", "agency"→"power"), and stray "text:" placeholder artifacts that had dropped real content. Added a protected-terms glossary (`data/i18n-glossary.json`) so brands, acronyms, author names, and numbers stay intact in any future translation. Legitimate technical terms were deliberately preserved.

## v10.79.1 — June 16, 2026 (Translation quality fixes — Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi)

### Fixed

- Corrected context-blind machine-translation errors in the Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi course pages (200 strings across all four languages). The bulk machine pass had rendered "development practitioner" as "doctor/physician", "Marginalia" as "edges/shores", "Understanding Development" as ungrammatical word-salad, "Field Companions" as "village residents"/"female friends", "Course Papers" as "exam papers", "Evidence-Based Practice" as "medical treatment", "Sixty-eight terms" as "eighty-six", and the brand name "ImpactMojo" as "Impact: Mojo" — all now read naturally and correctly. Legitimate technical terms (e.g. "biomedical sciences", causal-inference "treatment") were deliberately left untouched. The core UI strings were already hand-reviewed and unaffected.

## v10.79.0 — June 11, 2026 (Live Case Challenges — real case packets)

### For Learners

- **Every Live Case Challenge now comes with downloadable case materials.** All 9 challenges have a full case packet — realistic documents and datasets to actually work the problem: a flawed logframe to redesign, a deliberately-bad nutrition dashboard plus a sample CSV, an anonymised AI-targeting dataset with built-in bias to audit, two costed nutrition interventions to compare, a GESI programme + mid-term review, Gandhi's writings and a satyagraha framework, an RTI Act primer + PMGSY guide + application template, an adolescent-nutrition KAP survey + BCC template, and a field-team profile + SEL competency framework. [Browse the challenges](/challenges.html)

## v10.78.0 — June 11, 2026 (Five canonical companions + a link & gating sweep)

### For Learners

- **Poor Economics** (Banerjee & Duflo) — an interactive companion to the Nobel-winning case for fighting poverty through rigorously-tested interventions. [Read it](/BookSummaries/poor-economics-companion.html)
- **Why Nations Fail** (Acemoglu & Robinson) — a companion to the Nobel-winning theory of inclusive versus extractive institutions. [Read it](/BookSummaries/why-nations-fail-companion.html)
- **Development as Freedom** (Amartya Sen) — a companion to Sen's reframing of development as the expansion of human freedoms and the capability approach. [Read it](/BookSummaries/development-as-freedom-companion.html)
- **Capital in the Twenty-First Century** (Piketty) — a companion to the landmark study of wealth and inequality. [Read it](/BookSummaries/capital-in-the-21st-century-companion.html)
- **India After Gandhi** (Ramachandra Guha) — a companion to the definitive history of the world's largest democracy. [Read it](/BookSummaries/india-after-gandhi-companion.html)

### Fixed

- Repaired broken/dead links across the site: Live Case Challenge resources and Dataverse skill items no longer render dead links; capitalized `/Labs` and `/Games` directory links now resolve; corrected several wrong BookSummary filenames, course-link case mismatches, and dead "next steps" links in practice packs.
- The Theory of Change Workbench is now consistently labelled free (it was mislabelled "Premium" in the catalog and search index despite being open to everyone).
- The four Pro tools (Research Question Builder, ToR Builder, Qualitative Insights Lab, Statistical Code Converter) are now properly gated to their subscription tiers instead of being fully usable while only the homepage cards were locked.

## v10.77.0 — June 10, 2026 (The Long View — "Who owns India")

### For Learners

- **"Who owns India" — a new chart in The Long View** showing India's wealth concentration: two bars on one scale (the population, then total wealth, split among the same groups) with ribbons linking each. The bottom half of Indians hold about 6% of the wealth; the top 1% hold 40%. Built from the World Inequality Lab's *Income and Wealth Inequality in India, 1922–2023*. [See it](/the-long-view.html)
- **A new "great" in the gallery** — PerThirtySix's *American Wealth Inequality*, the visualization that inspired the India chart, added to The Classics & Greats.

### Added

- New `splitFlow` renderer in `js/longview-charts.js` (population-vs-resource bars with linking ribbons) and a `c-wealth` original on `the-long-view.html`, wired into `ORDER`/`DETAILS` so the standalone `chart.html?c=c-wealth` and prev/next navigation work. Added the PerThirtySix card to the gallery's masterworks list.

## v10.76.1 — June 10, 2026 (Homepage + all courses translated & stored)

### For Learners

- **The homepage and all 15 flagship courses are now fully translated into Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi — and stored with the site**, so they load instantly in your language with nothing to fetch. ~3,650 phrases per language are now built in. Other pages keep filling in automatically as you read.

### Changed

- Translations now load as a shared common dictionary (`i18n/<lang>.json`) plus per-page files (`i18n/pages/<lang>/<page>.json`), so each page only downloads its own strings. Generated once via `scripts/bulk-translate.py` through the Sarvam endpoint and frozen into the repo; the live fallback stays on as a safety net for anything not yet stored.

## v10.76.0 — June 10, 2026 (Evaluation Essentials Kit — now all 27 products)

### For Learners

- **The Evaluation Essentials Kit now includes every product** — all 12 templates, all four workbooks, both trainer decks, plus the four refreshers, two formulae posters and three field checklists. That's 27 products (worth ₹6,373 bought separately) in one download for **₹2,499** — over 60% off. [Get the kit](/products/evaluation-essentials-kit/)

### Changed

- Re-scoped the Evaluation Essentials Kit from 15 → all 27 products and repriced ₹1,999 → ₹2,499. Rebuilt the kit zip (32 files — the 27 products, with the five Excel templates flattened to XLSX + Word companion guide) and re-uploaded it to the private fulfilment bucket. Updated the kit landing page (contents, price, lede, delivery steps, form, UPI amount), the new amount-encoded UPI QR (`upi-evaluation-essentials-kit-2499.png`, old ₹1,999 QR removed), the `products.html` bundle card, the kit cross-sell box on all 15 member product pages, and the money-flow runbook.

## v10.75.0 — June 9, 2026 (Premium Calculators)

### For Learners

- **Two new premium Excel calculators** join the Products & Kits store — each an editable spreadsheet plus a Word companion guide:
  - **Evaluation & Research Costing Calculator** (₹12,000) — cost any study from the ground up: turn a sample size into enumerator-days, then a funder-ready budget with phase splits, three scenarios and India 2026 benchmarks. [View](/products/evaluation-costing-calculator/)
  - **Programme Unit Economics & Pricing Calculator** (₹15,000) — price a product or training line and test whether the model works: unit economics, LTV vs CAC, market sizing, and a five-year path to break-even. [View](/products/unit-economics-calculator/)
- **Refreshed product samples** — the free watermarked previews across the store now reflect the rewritten v2.0 templates, with fuller worked sections.

- **Every Excel template now comes with a Word companion guide** (Logframe, Activity Budget & Costing, Proposal Scoring, Stakeholder Map, Results Framework) — delivered together as a zip.

### Added

- New "Premium Calculators" category on `products.html` (`#calculators`) and two product landing pages under `/products/`. Search-index, sitemap, UPI QR codes, and the order→file delivery map all wired up; the two calculator masters (XLSX + guide, zipped) added to the private fulfilment bucket.
- **Refreshed the entire fulfilment bucket** from the rewritten v2.0 masters — all 27 product files re-uploaded, the 5 Excel templates re-zipped with their new Word guides (delivery map updated `.xlsx`→`.zip`), and the Evaluation Essentials Kit bundle rebuilt.

## v10.74.0 — June 9, 2026 (Advisory Board Pro)

### For Learners

- **Advisory Board Pro** — a new Professional-tier tool where you pose a real development-sector dilemma and a panel of AI advisors (a development economist, a field practitioner, a behavioural scientist, and a critic) debate it from every angle before the moderator synthesises. Add your own discussion points to steer the debate, and export the full transcript. A free read-only preview shows a worked example. [Launch](/premium-tools/advisory-board-pro.html)

### Added

- `premium-tools/advisory-board-pro.html` + `/api/advisor-panel` orchestrator. Each seat is voiced by a different model (Groq-hosted Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 4 Scout, Llama 3.1 8B, and GPT-OSS 120B) so the advisors sound genuinely distinct; the browser requests one turn at a time to keep every call short. Gated to the Professional tier two ways: the page hides the live tool client-side via `ImpactMojoAuth`, and the function independently verifies the Supabase session + `subscription_tier` before spending on any LLM call. Per-user daily quota as defence in depth. Brings the premium-tools lineup to 10.

## v10.73.4 — June 9, 2026 (Fix: flagship course content not loading)

### Fixed

- **Flagship course modules now load again for returning users.** If your saved login session had gone stale, the course-content service rejected the whole request, so *no* modules appeared (just "Unable to load course content"). The loader now retries anonymously on that error, so the public module always loads — and signing in again restores the gated modules.

## v10.73.3 — June 9, 2026 (Homepage navigation translated)

### For Learners

- **The full site navigation, homepage hero, and trust bar now read in your language instantly** — Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi. Since the menu appears on every page, this lifts the translated experience across the whole site (409 hand-checked strings now built in).

## v10.73.2 — June 9, 2026 (More translations + live fill-in)

### For Learners

- **Much more of the site now reads in your language.** Added a second batch of hand-checked Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi translations covering course titles, section headings, buttons, and the purchase flow (357 common strings in all). On top of the instant built-in translations, the rest of a page's text now fills in automatically as you read it — so whole pages, not just the menus, switch language.

### Changed

- Re-enabled the live `/api/translate` fallback (Sarvam Mayura, server-cached) now that the account has credits. It runs *after* the static dictionary is applied, so the shell still renders instantly and only the long-tail body content is fetched and cached. Disable per-page with `window.IMX_LIVE_TRANSLATE = false`.

## v10.73.1 — June 9, 2026 (Language switcher fix + hard-wired translations)

### For Learners

- **The site now switches language instantly — no spinner, no waiting.** Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi translations of the navigation, footer, and common labels are now built into the site itself, so picking a language is immediate and works even offline. We're expanding the translated text page by page.

### Fixed

- **Language switching no longer hangs on an endless spinner.** Pages were loading two competing translation systems at once — the legacy Google Translate widget and the newer Sarvam-backed switcher — and they fought each other in a DOM-mutation loop that kept the globe spinner running forever. Removed the legacy Google Translate widget (`js/translate.js`) from every page and standardised on the single switcher.

### Changed

- **Translations are now static-first.** The switcher (`js/translate-sarvam.js`) loads a hard-wired dictionary shipped at `/i18n/<lang>.json` (built once by `scripts/build-i18n.py` from a human-reviewed `i18n/overrides/` layer) and applies it synchronously — no API call, no credits, no spinner. The live Sarvam fallback is now opt-in only (`window.IMX_LIVE_TRANSLATE`), so the page can never hang on the network again. Batch 1 covers the 121 most-repeated site-wide shell strings.

## v10.73.0 — June 8, 2026 (12 new downloadable products)

### For Learners

- **More to buy on the Products page:** 3 new fill-in **workbooks** (MEL from Scratch 90-day, Theory of Change workshop, Survey design — ₹499), 4 one-page **concept refresher sheets** (sampling, causal designs, OECD-DAC, quant/qual/mixed — ₹99), 2 A3 **formulae posters** (MEL & statistics, econometrics — ₹149), and 3 practical **checklists** (field readiness, ethics & DPDP consent, proposal review — ₹99). Editable items stay Word/Excel; references are branded print-ready PDFs.

### Added

- 12 product landing pages under `/products/`, branded full files (workbooks .docx; refreshers/posters/checklists .pdf) in the private Supabase bucket, per-price UPI QRs, and the one-click fulfilment map extended to cover them. Added to the products page and sitemap.

## v10.72.0 — June 8, 2026

### Changed

- **ToR Builder is now ToR Builder Pro**, a standalone premium tool alongside the other Pro tools: moved to **`/premium-tools/tor-builder.html`** (old paths 301-redirect), listed in the Premium Tools lineup on the Products page and catalog, and now **mentioned in the body of the "How to Write a ToR" blog post** (in the three-dimensions section) as well as the further-reading list.
- **Products page trimmed of services** — Coaching and Workshops removed; only a single tiny "Subscribe by UPI" line remains. It's a products page now, not a services page.

## v10.71.0 — June 8, 2026

### Changed

- Moved the **ToR Builder** from `/BookCompanionTools/tor-generator.html` to **`/tools/tor-builder.html`** — it's a practitioner tool, not a book companion. The old URL 301-redirects to the new one, and all references (catalog, search index, sitemap, the ToR Practice Pack, the ToR blog, the ToR product page) were updated.

## v10.70.1 — June 8, 2026 (One-click order fulfilment)

### Added

- Every UPI "I've paid" submission (products and subscriptions) now auto-emails the admin a single **Confirm & deliver** button (`netlify/functions/submission-created.mjs`). Clicking it (`/api/confirm`, HMAC-signed) emails the buyer a 7-day signed download link, or marks the subscription paid and active — no manual commands. UPI can't be auto-verified, so this keeps the one human glance ("did the money arrive?") and automates everything else.

## v10.70.0 — June 8, 2026 (UPI subscriptions — no gateway, no fees)

### For Learners

- **Subscribe to Premium by UPI** at [/subscribe/](https://www.impactmojo.in/subscribe/) — pick Practitioner or Organisation (monthly or annual), pay by UPI, and you're activated within 24 hours. No card and no auto-debit: for monthly plans we email a fresh UPI QR each cycle, and you renew only if you want to.

### Added

- `subscriptions` + `subscription_payments` tables in Supabase; `/api/subscribe` (creates the subscription + first invoice + emails a UPI pay link), `subscription-billing` (monthly scheduled function that raises each due invoice with a fresh QR/reference and emails it), `/api/sub-admin` (admin reconciliation), and a client-side QR pay page at `/subscribe/pay/`. Linked from Premium and the Products page.

## v10.69.0 — June 8, 2026 (The full gated product store)

### For Learners

- **15 practitioner products, each with its own page** — ToR, Logframe, Budget & Costing, MEL Plan, Proposal Scoring Rubric, Survey Instrument, FGD Guide, Donor Report, Stakeholder Map, Theory of Change Canvas, Results Framework, Data & Consent pack (₹199 each), the Commissioning Workbook and two Trainer Decks (₹499), and the **Evaluation Essentials Kit** bundle (₹1,999). Every product page has a value diagram, free watermarked sample pages, and a UPI / WhatsApp checkout; the editable file is emailed within 24 hours of payment.

### Added

- `/products/<slug>/` landing pages for all 15 products + the bundle, sharing `/css/product.css`; deep-watermarked samples + per-product UPI QR codes; `netlify/functions/mint-download.mjs` (admin) to issue signed download links from the private store.

### Changed / Security

- Products page rebuilt around the gated pages (no free direct downloads). The full files now live in a **private Supabase Storage bucket** (+ a Google Drive master), never the public site; the previously public `/downloads/` master files were removed from the repo.

## v10.68.0 — June 8, 2026 (Gated product pages — ToR Template pilot)

### For Learners

- **ToR Template — full product page** at [/products/tor-template/](https://www.impactmojo.in/products/tor-template/): a long-form landing page with a value diagram, watermarked sample pages, a ₹199 UPI checkout (QR + ID) and a simple order form. The editable file is emailed within 24 hours of payment. This is the pilot for a 15-product, gated store.

### Added

- `products/tor-template/index.html` (gated landing page), a deep-watermarked sample (`downloads/samples/`), and a UPI QR (`assets/images/upi/`). The Products page ToR card now links to this page (₹199) instead of a free download. Added to sitemap.



## v10.67.0 — June 8, 2026 (Real downloadable products)

### For Learners

- **Templates, Workbooks & Decks** — the Products page now leads with real, editable files you download and own: a **ToR** template, **Logframe**, **Activity Budget & costing** (with live formulas), **MEL Plan**, **Proposal Scoring Rubric**, a **Commissioning Research workbook**, and an **Introduction to MEL trainer deck** with facilitator notes — plus a one-click **Evaluation Essentials Kit** bundle. Free to use and adapt under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

### Changed

- `/products.html` restructured to be product-first: downloadable templates/workbooks/decks at the top, then Practice Packs and premium tools, with memberships and services moved into a compact "Plans & Services" strip at the bottom.

### Added

- `downloads/` — 7 generated Office files (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx) + a bundled .zip. Evaluation Essentials Kit added to `search-index.json`.

## v10.66.2 — June 8, 2026

### Changed

- Discoverability: **Products & Kits** added to the Learn nav dropdown (all 14 nav pages incl. the homepage) and to the site footer; **System Status** + **Products & Kits** now both sit in the footer across the top-level pages. The ToR Builder remains discoverable via the catalog (Labs) and the ToR Practice Pack / blog cross-links.

## v10.66.1 — June 8, 2026

### Fixed

- The Long View companion pages (gallery, evidence map, numbers in the news): the "← The Long View" topbar back-link wrapped onto multiple lines and collided with the logo on narrow phones — it now stays on one line, with a tighter mobile topbar layout.

### Changed

- Status alert emails now send from the verified `notifications@impactmojo.in` address (status monitoring is now wired to GitHub-issue + email alerts).

## v10.66.0 — June 8, 2026 (New visualisation in the gallery)

### For Learners

- **"Which Jobs Are Most Exposed to AI"** added to the visualisation gallery (The Long View → The classics & the greats) — the Washington Post's bubble field of US occupations plotting AI exposure against adaptability, sized by workforce. Added under a new **Work & Technology** topic filter.

## v10.65.0 — June 8, 2026 (ToR Builder + Products & Kits hub)

### For Learners

- **ToR Builder** — a free interactive tool that turns structured prompts into a complete, professional Terms of Reference plus a costing sheet, exportable as Markdown or PDF. It encodes the ImpactMojo ToR framework (the three dimensions of enquiry, with method suggestions), autosaves as you type, and ships with a worked example. Find it in the catalog under Labs, or alongside the ToR Practice Pack and the "How to Write a ToR" guide.
- **Products & Kits** — a single page that gathers everything you can buy on ImpactMojo (memberships, all 18 Practice Packs, premium tools, coaching and workshops) and links straight to each, while making clear that the bulk of the platform stays free.

### Added

- `/BookCompanionTools/tor-generator.html` (ToR Builder) wired into the catalog (Labs), `search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, and cross-linked from the ToR Practice Pack and ToR blog post.
- `/products.html` curation hub linking existing paid resources (no duplicated content); added to `sitemap.xml` and footer links.

## v10.64.0 — June 8, 2026 (Status monitoring: real uptime + auto-alerts)

### For Learners

- **Real 90-day uptime on the Status page** — the status page now shows true availability measured across all visitors (not just your own browser), backed by a server-side health check that runs every 15 minutes. A "System Status" link now appears in the site footer across the platform.

### Added

- Server-side status monitoring: `netlify/functions/status-probe.mjs` (scheduled every 15 min) probes all 11 components, stores a 90-day history in Netlify Blobs, and is flap-resistant (an outage is only declared after 2 consecutive failed checks). `netlify/functions/status-history.mjs` serves that history at `/api/status-history` for the page to render.
- Automated incident alerts: on a confirmed outage the probe auto-opens a GitHub issue (auto-closed on recovery) and sends an email via a new self-contained `supabase/functions/status-alert` function (Resend). Light auto-remediation fires a Supabase keepalive when the backend looks down (the common free-tier auto-pause). Both alert paths degrade gracefully when their credentials are absent.
- "System Status" footer link added across 33 top-level pages.

### Fixed

- Status page no longer reports the Supabase backend as "down": the probe now sends the public anon key to `/auth/v1/health` (which 401s without it) and treats any non-5xx response as reachable.

## v10.63.0 — June 8, 2026 (System Status page)

### For Learners

- **System Status** — a live status page at [/status.html](https://www.impactmojo.in/status.html) that checks every part of ImpactMojo in real time — the website, course catalog, game library, resource library, blog, docs, search, accounts, translation, and hosting. Each component is probed live from your browser and refreshes automatically every 60 seconds, with a colour-coded "All Systems Operational" banner and a rolling 90-day uptime view.

### Added

- New `status.html` with client-side health probes for 11 components across two groups (Website & Pages, Data & APIs); auto-refresh every 60s, 10s timeout, >2s = degraded; 90-day uptime strip from `localStorage`. Added to `sitemap.xml` and footer Resources links.

## v10.62.0 — June 7, 2026 (Two new data-literacy pages for The Long View)

### For Learners

- **Numbers in the News** — a reader's field guide to the statistics that pass for facts. Eight ways numbers mislead — the missing denominator, percent vs percentage points, base rates and false positives, the truncated axis, the cherry-picked baseline, margin of error, correlation vs causation, and survivorship bias — each with a small interactive example you can poke at, plus a pocket checklist of questions to ask any number. Find it under **The Long View**.
- **The Evidence Map** — an interactive guide to evidence gap maps: how to read what works in development, how strong the evidence is, and where the gaps are. Includes a clickable illustrative map for the education sector and links straight to the authoritative, continuously-updated maps from 3ie, Cochrane, the Campbell Collaboration and J-PAL. Find it under **The Long View**.

## v10.61.0 — June 7, 2026 (AI and Development — a new Deep Dive)

### For Learners

- **AI and Development** — a new curated Deep Dive that separates what artificial intelligence has genuinely achieved for anti-poverty work from what is merely being sold. Thirteen annotated readings hold two stories together: the breakthroughs (predicting poverty from satellites and phone data, AI against the SDGs) and the critique (decolonial AI, data colonialism, the politics of training data, Crawford's *Atlas of AI*), before turning to digital public infrastructure, the large-language-model moment, and what an equitable AI agenda would require in the Global South. Find it under **Deep Dives**.

## v10.60.0 — June 7, 2026 (Climate Migration in South Asia — a new Deep Dive)

### For Learners

- **Climate Migration in South Asia** — a new curated Deep Dive on how a warming climate is reshaping where people in the region can live and work. Thirteen annotated readings move from the science and the headline projections (the IPCC's AR6, the World Bank's *Groundswell*) through the framing that reshaped the field — migration as adaptation, and the "trapped populations" too poor to move — into South Asia's specific deltas, coasts, and drylands, and out to the hard questions of protection, Loss and Damage, and who pays. A clear-eyed guide past the "climate refugee" headlines. Find it under **Deep Dives**.

## v10.59.0 — June 7, 2026 (The Care Economy — a new Deep Dive)

### For Learners

- **The Care Economy** — a new curated Deep Dive on the unpaid work that holds every economy up, and that the national accounts still refuse to count. Fourteen annotated readings run from the feminist economics that exposed the gap (Marilyn Waring, Nancy Folbre, Shahra Razavi's "care diamond") through the time-use data that finally measured it (India's 2019 survey, the ILO's global estimates, Oxfam's *Time to Care*) to Diane Elson's Recognize–Reduce–Redistribute agenda now written into the SDGs — with a close look at why the care burden falls so heavily on women in South Asia. Find it under **Deep Dives**.

## v10.58.0 — June 7, 2026 (The Stunting Puzzle — a new Deep Dive)

### For Learners

- **The Stunting Puzzle** — a new curated Deep Dive reading list on why South Asia's children are among the most stunted in the world despite rising incomes. Thirteen annotated readings move from the puzzle itself (the "Asian Enigma") through how stunting is measured and what it costs over a lifetime, into the contested causes — maternal nutrition and women's status, sanitation and the first 1,000 days — and out to the evidence on what works, from Bangladesh's surprising decline to India's POSHAN Abhiyaan. Find it under **Deep Dives**.

## v10.57.0 — June 7, 2026 (Logframe 101 — the logical framework, built from the results chain up)

### For Learners

- **Logframe 101** — a new free, 100-slide course on the logical framework, the matrix nearly every funder asks for. It builds the tool from the results chain up: inputs, activities and outputs (what you control) through outcomes (what you influence) to impact (what you contribute to), with the output-to-outcome gap and attribution made plain. Then it works through the four columns — results, indicators (SMART, with baselines and disaggregation), means of verification, and the assumptions and risk that keep the matrix honest — before showing how to build it, test it vertically and horizontally, and weigh its real critiques and alternatives (outcome mapping, adaptive management). Practical throughout, with donor formats and worked examples. Find it under **101 Courses**.

## v10.56.0 — June 7, 2026 (Data Visualization 101 — the companion course to The Long View)

### For Learners

- **Data Visualization 101** — a new free, 100-slide course on turning numbers into honest, clear charts, and the natural companion to *The Long View*. It works through what a chart is actually for, the grammar of marks and channels (why position beats colour), how to choose a chart from your question, and a full section on the ways charts mislead — truncated axes, dual axes, cherry-picked windows, radius-vs-area, correlation drawn as causation, and Simpson's paradox. Further sections cover colour (sequential, diverging, qualitative, and colour-blind-safe palettes), writing titles and annotations, designing readable tables, showing spread and uncertainty, mapping data honestly (rates not counts, cartograms, classification), audience and accessibility, and a practical workflow with tools and reading. Find it under **101 Courses**.

## v10.55.0 — June 6, 2026 (The Long View — an original data-visualization studio)

### For Learners

- **The Long View — an ImpactMojo original data-visualization studio, and a gallery of the greats** — a new showcase with four wings. A **Data Wing** of six original charts, each drawn from scratch in your browser from a named, public dataset: the global fall in extreme poverty (World Bank), India's plunging under-five mortality (UN IGME), multidimensional poverty by caste (NFHS-4, with the NFHS-5 national trend), CO₂ per capita and the climate-justice gap (Global Carbon Project), India's warming since 1901 (IMD), and the recent rise in women's workforce participation (PLFS). A **Frameworks Wing** of five original diagrams of the models we teach — Arnstein's ladder, the results chain and the attribution gap, the poverty trap, intersectionality, and the systems iceberg. A **Masters' Wing** that rebuilds four timeless classics in code — Florence Nightingale's rose of mortality, Minard's march on Moscow, John Snow's cholera map, and a data portrait in the style of W. E. B. Du Bois. And **The Greats**, a filterable gallery pointing to modern masterworks from Gapminder, Our World in Data, The Pudding, ProPublica, the People's Archive of Rural India and more. Every original figure is traceable to its source. Find it under **Showcase → The Long View**.

## v10.54.0 — June 4, 2026 (Causal Inference flagship — gold-standard rewrite)

### For Learners

- **The Causal Inference for Development course is rebuilt to a gold standard.** All thirteen modules — from the counterfactual and potential outcomes through matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, synthetic control and causal machine learning, to reading evaluations, theory-based methods when there is no counterfactual, and a capstone — now carry **properly typeset equations**, **causal-graph diagrams**, a **worked example from a real Indian programme with a results table**, **runnable R and Stata code**, a **common-pitfalls box**, and a **practice problem set with worked solutions** in every module. The writing was rebuilt for rigour and clarity throughout, with current references (Imbens & Rubin, Angrist & Pischke, Cunningham, Cattaneo, Callaway & Sant'Anna, Chernozhukov, and more).
- **Course content now loads reliably.** Lessons that could previously hang on a slow connection now time out and retry automatically, and the maths displays cleanly on phones as well as desktops.

## v10.53.0 — June 4, 2026 (Marginalia series + second essay: The Fine Print)

### For Learners

- **The Fine Print — a new Marginalia cartoon essay** — ten more hand-drawn cartoons on the gap between the headline claim and the buried condition: inclusion announced from the top of a staircase, "community ownership" without the budget, an evidence-based brief that never reaches the allocation, a glowing dashboard above an empty clinic, disruptive innovation where a handpump just needed repair, and resilience that never reduces the shock. Each is backed by two or three cited, evidence-based paragraphs — from Arnstein's and Hart's ladders of participation and India's RPwD Act to the WHO's commercial determinants of health and the *At Risk* vulnerability framework.
- **Marginalia now has its own home** — the cartoon-essay series lives at a single landing page gathering both essays (*Capacity for Irony* and *The Fine Print*), reachable from the **Specials → Marginalia** menu.

## v10.52.0 — June 4, 2026 (New Special: Capacity for Irony — Marginalia)

### For Learners

- **Capacity for Irony — Marginalia** — ten hand-drawn cartoons from the development sector, where the language of help meets the people it claims to help. In each, someone in a lanyard says the thing the sector says, and a field worker, ASHA, farmer or beneficiary says the thing the sector tends not to write down. Every punchline is backed by two or three cited, evidence-based paragraphs — from the Grand Bargain's localisation gap and "pilotitis" to Longwe's "patriarchal cooking pot" and Toyama's Law of Amplification — with a full sources list. A companion in spirit to the *Between the Logframes* podcast. Find it under **Specials → Long-form Reading**.

## v10.51.0 — June 4, 2026 (New flagship: Causal Inference for Development)

### For Learners

- **New flagship course: Causal Inference for Development** — a free, design-based course for people who design, read and commission impact evidence. Thirteen modules carry you from the potential-outcomes model through the estimator toolkit — randomised trials, matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, synthetic control and causal machine learning — to the practitioner's real job: judging which design a claim can bear. R and Stata throughout, with Indian programme cases, and a **65-term interactive lexicon** plus a downloadable Excel version. The platform now has **15 flagship courses**.

## v10.50.0 — June 4, 2026 (Flagship consistency: themes, coach photos, mobile menu)

### For Learners

- **Three courses no longer look "blacked out" in light mode** — Data Visualization, Media for Development, and The Evidence Question (MEL) now show a light hero and sidebar in light mode (and dark in dark mode), matching the other flagships. This was most noticeable on phones.
- **Every course now shows a photo of your coach** — the Gender course previously showed initials in its coaching notes; it now uses the same Varna and Vandana coach photos as the rest of the platform, so the guidance feels personal and consistent everywhere.
- **The mobile menu button is now clearly labelled "☰ Contents"** on every flagship, so it's obvious how to open the course outline on a phone.

### Changed

- Added Course structured data (schema.org JSON-LD) to all 14 flagship course pages for richer search-engine results, and removed a stray 1-hour page auto-refresh that interrupted reading and was an accessibility issue.

## v10.49.0 — June 3, 2026 (Livelihoods on the flagship template)

### For Learners

- **The Livelihoods course now uses the same flagship template as every other course** — shared navigation, sidebar, hero, light/dark theming and typography, so all 14 flagships look and feel consistent. The course content (rural NRLM/MGNREGA, urban gig/vendor work, Skill India) is unchanged.

## v10.48.0 — June 3, 2026 (Power BI flagship redesign)

### For Learners

- **The Power BI course now matches the look and feel of every other flagship** — the same site navigation, sidebar, hero, light/dark theming and typography as Development Economics, so it reads as a polished part of the platform. Every hands-on extra is kept: the interactive licence-cost and measure-vs-column calculators, the recreated Power BI interface panels, hand-drawn diagrams, and per-module self-check quizzes. The matching lexicon page was rebuilt the same way, the writing was edited throughout for a clearer practitioner voice, and the course now links an **AI Study Companion**, a downloadable **Excel lexicon**, and a **course papers pack**.

## v10.47.0 — June 3, 2026 (Power BI flagship)

### For Learners

- **New flagship course: Power BI for Practitioners** — a free, hands-on course that builds honest dashboards from real South Asian survey data across eight lab-driven modules: Power Query, star schemas, DAX, and visualisation ethics, with the free-tier and privacy realities made plain. Includes an interactive lexicon.

### Changed

- The flagship course count is now **14** (Power BI added; the Livelihoods card, previously only in the course modal, is now also shown in the homepage flagship grid). Course counts updated across the homepage, catalog, search, sitemap and docs.
- **Today's Spotlight now draws from a refreshed, larger pool** (31 items, up from 12) spanning all 7 content types — flagship courses (incl. Power BI), labs, deep dives, games, book companions, timelines and reference libraries — so the homepage feature stays fresh for longer.

## v10.46.0 — June 3, 2026 (ImpactLex dedupe)

### Fixed

- **ImpactLex no longer lists five terms twice** — Forest Rights Act, Human Development Index, Multidimensional Poverty Index, Purchasing Power Parity and Randomized Controlled Trial each had an acronym-variant that collided on the same id. The snapshot now merges them (390 → 385 unique terms), keeping the richest definition and backfilling missing examples/acronyms. Root cause fixed in `scripts/impactlex-migrate.mjs` (added an id-level dedupe pass) so it cannot recur on regeneration.

## v10.45.0 — June 3, 2026 (Consistency polish)

### For Learners

- **Clearer licensing on every page** — each page footer now states that the code is under MIT and the learning content under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, and all content pages now name the same licence consistently.
- **The Accessibility Statement page gains the standard System / Light / Dark theme switch**, matching the rest of the site and respecting your device's theme.

## v10.44.0 — June 3, 2026 (Documentation in 4 languages)

### For Learners

- **The full documentation is now available in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi** — every guide (platform overview, getting started, games/labs/courses, certificates, policies and more) has a curated translation, with a language switcher in the docs viewer. Anything not yet translated falls back gracefully to English.

## v10.43.0 — June 3, 2026 (Nav consistency + vernacular UI)

### Changed

- **Updates & Dojos pages now use the standard site navigation** — a single fixed header with a working mobile menu and a unified theme toggle, fixing the duplicate navbars and conflicting theme scripts left behind by an earlier nav transplant.
- **Press Kit and navigation UI strings are now curated in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi** (41 keys × 4 languages), replacing the machine-translation fallback for those strings. Marked pending native-speaker review.

## v10.42.0 — June 3, 2026 (Dataverse + Timelines)

### For Learners

- **14 more open-data sources in the Dataverse** (now 296) — IndiaDataPortal, PRS, Digital Sansad, IPUMS, V-Dem, ACLED, RBI DBIE, SHRUG, Bhuvan and more.
- **Timelines extended to 2026** — added recent milestones (COP29's $300bn finance goal, the 2023 Women's Reservation Act, and more) across the climate, policy, rights, development-thinking and MEL timelines.

## v10.41.0 — June 2, 2026 (Today's Spotlight)

### For Learners

- **A daily "Today's Spotlight" on the homepage** — every day it features a different course, lab, deep dive, game or timeline, so there's always something fresh to discover.

## v10.40.0 — June 2, 2026 (Game Library URL + single entry)

### For Learners

- **The Game Library moved to `/game-library`** and now calls everything "games" (the 17 simulations + 117 puzzles, 134 total). Old `/puzzle-library` links redirect automatically. The homepage now shows one Game Library entry instead of a confusing games-vs-simulations split.

## v10.39.0 — June 2, 2026 (Game Library + homepage)

### For Learners

- **Game Library now includes the 17 interactive simulations** alongside the 117 puzzles — filter by Simulation, Crossword, Quiz, Word Search and more, all in one place (134 games total).
- **All 16 Deep Dives now appear on the homepage** (was showing only 4).

## v10.38.0 — June 2, 2026 (Blog evidence upgrades)

### For Learners

- **22 blog posts upgraded to a defensible-citation standard** — claims across the Methods, MEAL, Theory-of-Change and education posts are now backed by real, web-verified sources (Banerjee/Duflo, World Bank, J-PAL, UNESCO, OECD-DAC, ICMR and more); a few unsourceable/fabricated statistics were removed or corrected.

## v10.37.0 — June 2, 2026 (Cash transfers explainer)

### For Learners

- **New blog post — "What the Evidence Actually Says About Cash Transfers"** — an accessible, fully-cited explainer for practitioners: are cash transfers "wasted", UCT vs CCT, cash vs in-kind, delivery & leakage, and India's DBT. Pairs with the Cash Transfers Deep Dive.

## v10.36.0 — June 2, 2026 (10 new Deep Dives)

### For Learners

## v10.28.0 — May 23, 2026 (Complete Practice Packs series + blog rewrite)

### For Learners

- **16 new interactive Practice Packs** — completing the full series of 18. 9 Subject Packs (SEL, Livelihoods, Gender, Education, Health, Climate, Policy, Media, Governance) + 9 Method Packs (ToR Writing, Survey Instrument, Logframe, Costing, FGD, Critiquing Evidence, Stakeholder Mapping, Donor Reporting, MEL from Scratch). All interactive with in-browser auto-save, live capstone builder, MCQ self-checks.

## v10.27.0 — May 23, 2026 (Practice Packs v2 — interactive, two-track, PP02 Livelihoods)

### For Learners

- **Practice Packs are now interactive.** Every pack works like a lab: in-browser forms auto-save, the capstone builds itself when you click "Build my brief," export as markdown or print as PDF. Nothing transmitted; data stays in your browser.
- **PP01 SEL Evaluation retrofitted** with the new interactive pattern (form editor, saved answers, self-check quizzes, live capstone, progress bar).

- **Landing restructured into two tracks**: Subject Packs (9 — per-domain) + Method Packs (9 — cross-cutting toolkit).

## v10.26.2 — May 23, 2026 (napkin diagrams for accessibility blog)

The `/blog/making-accessible-websites.html` post was the last using only inline SVG figures. Added 2 napkin.ai diagrams (5-pass trajectory + the 5 root causes of accessibility violations). The 2 remaining inline SVGs (precise contrast-ratio table + checklist) kept intentionally because napkin would lose the precision.

## v10.26.1 — May 23, 2026 (Napkin diagrams for "Knowing What You Want" blog)

The blog post shipped without illustrations. Added two napkin.ai diagrams to match platform convention.

## v10.26.0 — May 23, 2026 (Practice Packs series launched)

A new content type on ImpactMojo: **Practice Packs**. Short, focused 3-hour sprints that take a practitioner from a job-to-be-done to a finished artefact. Sits between blog posts (read in 10 min) and flagship courses (multi-week commitment) — designed for the working practitioner with a real project waiting on a defensible artefact.

### For Learners

- **New section**: `/practice-packs/` — landing page listing the series (1 live, 9 upcoming)
- **First Practice Pack — SEL Evaluation: Design & Instruments** (PP01). 4 modules + capstone. Walk in with an SEL programme; walk out with a drafted evaluation design (research question, instruments, data plan, reporting outline). Includes 5 copy-to-clipboard templates.
- Nav link added to homepage; "New" badge.

### Roadmap (visible on landing page)

PP02 ToR Writing · PP03 Survey Instrument Design · PP04 Logframe Building · PP05 Activity-Based Costing · PP06 Focus Group Discussion · PP07 Critiquing Evidence Papers · PP08 Stakeholder Mapping · PP09 Donor Reporting · PP10 Building an MEL System from Scratch

## v10.25.5 — May 23, 2026 (Framework diversity propagated to SEL Course + Deep Dive)

After adding framework plurality to the SEL Simulation Game (v10.25.4), audited the SEL flagship course and the SEL Evaluation Deep Dive. Both had the same gaps. This release closes them.

### For Learners

- **SEL Course** now opens with an explicit "Frameworks We Draw From" section explaining how the course integrates CASEL, SEE Learning, WHO Life Skills, Delhi's Happiness Curriculum + EMC, Indian indigenous traditions (Tagore, Krishnamurti, Aurobindo, Nai Talim), and NEP 2020's full provisions (including teacher-side: NPST, 50-hr CPD, 4-yr B.Ed., teacher autonomy).
- **SEL Eval Deep Dive** expanded from 28 to 32 readings: added SEE Learning, NCERT AEP, Indian indigenous traditions, Delhi EMC; expanded NEP entry to surface teacher-side provisions.

## v10.25.4 — May 23, 2026 (SEL Simulation — Parent mode + framework diversity)

Addresses two cofounder feedback items: the game was missing a Parent perspective, and it framed NEP 2020 almost entirely from the child-facing side while leaning heavily on CASEL.

### For Learners

- **New Parent mode (5th lens)** in the SEL Simulation game. Six rounds covering: withdrawn child at dinner, teacher complaint, broken friendship, the day you snapped (modelling regulation), NEP school SEL outreach, and exam pressure + peer self-harm. Tracks Trust, Wellbeing, Connection, Modeling. India-specific adolescent helplines surfaced at end (iCall, Vandrevala, MANAS).
- **Framework plurality** — game now explicitly draws from CASEL, SEE Learning, WHO Life Skills, Delhi Happiness Curriculum + EMC, Indian indigenous traditions, and NEP 2020 (including its teacher-side provisions). Previous version was CASEL-heavy and child-focused on NEP.

## v10.25.3 — May 23, 2026 (ToR post — fix duplicate illustrations, all 4 napkin.ai)

The previous version rendered both the napkin.ai PNG and the inline SVG fallback simultaneously (the SVG's default style was set unconditionally, not only via the `onerror` handler), producing the impression of figures stacked back-to-back with no text between them. Fixed by removing all 4 SVG fallbacks now that real napkin.ai PNGs exist for every figure — including diagram 4 (research types), which previous attempts kept oversimplifying but a fresh prompt produced cleanly.

## v10.25.2 — May 23, 2026 (ToR post — research-types section + napkin.ai diagrams)

Expansion of the ToR blog post (v10.25.1) addressing a second common failure mode — clients asking for the wrong *type* of research — and upgrading three of the four diagrams to real napkin.ai-generated visuals.

### For Learners

- **New section: "What Kind of Research Do You Actually Need?"** — Covers three dimensions (question type: outcome vs process tracing vs theory-based; evidence type: quant vs qual vs mixed; time dimension: cross-sectional vs pre-post vs longitudinal vs retrospective) with the three common mismatches we see weekly.
- **Real napkin.ai diagrams** replace the inline SVG placeholders for the Anatomy of a ToR, Budget Tiers, and Pipeline diagrams. The research-types diagram still uses the inline SVG fallback because it shows all 9 sub-options + 3 mismatches, which napkin's summarisation can't preserve.

## v10.25.1 — May 23, 2026 (ToR-writing blog post)

Adds a single blog post answering one of the most common cofounder/client questions: how to write a Terms of Reference (or SoW, or RFP) that actually gets you useful research from an agency — and how to cost it honestly in India.

### For Learners

- **How to Write a ToR That Gets You Useful Research** — Practical, opinionated guide covering the nine ingredients of a good ToR, five common anti-patterns, India 2026 budget benchmarks (₹2L / ₹10L / ₹40L tiers with what each actually buys), and a pre-send checklist. Includes three diagrams (anatomy of a ToR, budget tiers, pipeline + failure points).

### Notes

- Diagrams are inline SVG in the napkin.ai style. PNG fallback paths exist at `assets/images/blog/writing-a-tor-for-research/illustration-{1,2,3}.png` — drop real napkin.ai exports there to swap.

## v10.25.0 — May 22, 2026 (Five-piece cofounder feature batch)

A five-deliverable release driven by cofounder feature requests — extending coverage of social-emotional learning, teacher evidence, livelihoods, and reflective practice. All evidence-grounded, India-context, practitioner-oriented.

### For Learners

- **SEL Simulation Game (4 modes)** — Step into Social-Emotional Learning from four chairs: teacher facing classroom dilemmas, program designer with a ₹40 lakh budget, evaluator deciding what can actually be known, or student (Anika, 12) navigating a school year. Each mode draws on NEP 2020, CASEL, and India-specific SEL research; scenarios are evidence-grounded with explicit "what the evidence shows" reflections after each choice.
- **Livelihoods in India: Rural, Urban, and Skills** (flagship course) — Comprehensive treatment across three modules: rural (NRLM/SHGs, MGNREGA, agriculture, financial inclusion); urban (informal sector, gig economy, vendors, domestic workers); skills (Skill India, apprenticeships, women's labour force participation, returns to training). Built for practitioners, evaluators, and policy actors who need both the policy landscape and the methodological rigour to read the field critically.
- **Teacher Evidence Lab** (interactive lab) — Filter 30+ teacher-effectiveness interventions by evidence quality, cost (per teacher per year), India relevance, type, and outcome. Built from rigorous evaluations 2000–2024: TaRL, contract teachers, pay-for-performance, mentoring, cascade training, multi-grade pedagogy, Mindspark, and more. Each card includes honest summary of what the evidence does and doesn't show.
- **SEL Evaluation in India** (deep dive) — Working syllabus on the methods that work and don't work for evaluating SEL in Indian school contexts. 28 readings across foundations, India evidence base, measurement, design choices, operational wisdom, and critiques. Includes opinionated "what works, what doesn't" summary.
- **Knowing What You Want** (blog) — A reflection on the quiet, hardest, most-skipped step in development work — actually knowing what you want, before you build the theory of change for it. Includes a 90-minute, 7-question exercise. Pairs naturally with the SEL course self-awareness material.

### Added

- `/Games/sel-simulation-game.html` (Game 17)
- `/Labs/teacher-evidence-lab.html` (Lab 12)
- `/DeepDives/sel-evaluation-india.html` (Deep Dive 6)
- `/blog/knowing-what-you-want.html` (Blog post)
- `/courses/livelihoods/` (Flagship 13)
- Entries added to `data/search-index.json` (5 entries), `catalog_data.json` (livelihoods), `data/deep-dives.json` (SEL eval), `sitemap.xml` (5 URLs)
- Blog card added to `blog.html`

### Changed

- Content counts updated sitewide: **53 courses (13 flagship + 40 foundational), 13 labs, 17 games, 16 deep dives** — was 52 / 11 / 16 / 5.

## v10.24.0 — May 20, 2026 (Flagship course chrome normalization)

Reader feedback was that the 13 flagship courses "looked different from each other" — mobile and desktop both. Over a session of audits, ran a line-by-line comparison against `devecon` (canonical) and closed the drift across 9 incremental PRs.

### For Learners

- **Consistent course experience** — all 13 flagship courses now share the same mobile and desktop chrome, so switching between Public Policy and Gender Studies (and the other 10) no longer feels like switching sites.
- **Mobile hamburger works on every course** — the menu button is in the same place on each course and tapping outside the open drawer closes it.
- **Accessibility widget present on every course** — the UserWay button is pinned right-middle on all 12, so font size / contrast / readability controls are one tap away regardless of course.

### Changed

- **Footer**: all 12 courses now render the same 3-column footer (Learn / Connect / Support / legal links / Docs link). Replaced 4 divergent footer patterns and removed a duplicate `<footer>` block in SEL.
- **Mobile (390px)**: body font 16px, sidebar drawer 280px, mobile-header height 56px, mobile-header top offset 0 — uniform across all 12. Was: body ranged 15–17px, drawer ranged 240–280px, header anchored 0–6px from top.
- **Desktop (1440px)**: sidebar width 260px, hero H1 `clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 3.5rem)` (→ 56px) — uniform across all 12. Was: sidebars 260/280px split 8/4; H1 sizes ranged 38.4–56px.
- **Theme storage key**: unified `impactmojo-theme` localStorage key across all 12 (was: 6 different keys).
- **Sidebar drawer toggle class**: `.sidebar.active` across all 12 (was: 2 courses used `.sidebar.open`).

### Fixed

- **devai** — hamburger button was invisible because a broken UserWay script (`data-account="xxxx"` placeholder) rendered as a giant blue button covering the right side of the mobile-header. Replaced with canonical config.
- **devai** — mobile-header element order was reversed (LOGO → HAM). Reordered to canonical HAM → LOGO → THEME.
- **dataviz** — `.mobile-menu-btn` had `position: fixed; top: 12px; left: 12px;` taking it out of the flex flow and floating over the "ImpactMojo" logo. Moved back into the flex container.
- **dataviz, gandhi** — UserWay accessibility widget rendered as a dark/black box at the default top-right position because the positioning CSS (`.uwy.userway_p5`, `.uwy .uai`) was missing. Added.
- **gender, pubpol** — no UserWay accessibility widget at all. Added.
- **devai, dataviz** — tapping outside the open mobile sidebar didn't close it. Added the `<div class="sidebar-overlay">` element, the canonical backdrop CSS, and the click handler.
- **Mobile quiz options** — text was wrapping one word per line at narrow viewports because long words inside flex containers had no overflow control. Added `min-width: 0; overflow-wrap: anywhere` to quiz option containers.

### Out of scope (deliberately deferred)

- gender + SEL mobile-header use a 44px spacer instead of the canonical theme toggle. Each course uses a different theme system (`.im-theme-btn` with `data-imtheme`) which needs a small per-course glue layer to wire up properly.
- devai + SEL are missing the `.sidebar-collapse-btn` (the desktop chevron that shrinks the sidebar to icons).
- gender's mobile-header brand text is "Gender Studies" instead of "ImpactMojo" — may be intentional, awaiting decision.

## v10.23.10 — May 1, 2026 (Handouts emoji → SVG)

Closed the open finding from v10.23.9: replaced **all 1,317 emoji instances** across 63 handout files (144 unique characters) with inline Sargam-style stroke SVGs.

- Mapping: viewBox 0 0 24 24, stroke 1.5px, currentColor — visually consistent with the Sargam icon family already used in DeepDives and the homepage nav.
- Self-contained inline SVGs (no sprite/CDN dependency) so handouts remain print-portable.
- Each modified file got a one-time `.hi-emoji { width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.15em; display: inline-block; }` rule injected into its existing `<style>` block so SVG sizing follows surrounding `font-size`.
- Skipped emojis inside `<script>` and `<style>` blocks (3 instances) to avoid breaking JS data structures.

Verification: 0 body emojis remain in any handout. File count unchanged (84 HTML + 1 PDF).

## v10.23.9 — May 1, 2026 (Handouts audit)

Audited the 85 handouts (84 HTML + 1 PDF across 10 top-level Track directories).

### Render bug fixed: stale TRACK_MAPPING in handouts.html

The `TRACK_MAPPING` config in `handouts.html` had **5 of 6** keys that didn't match disk folder names. As a result, only "Policy and Economics Track" was being rendered with its proper colour/order/displayName — the other 5 tracks were silently being grouped into "Other Resources" (alphabetical fallback). Fixed:

| TRACK_MAPPING key was | Now (matches disk) |
|---|---|
| Data Analysis Track | Data and Technology Track |
| Gender Studies Track | Gender Equity and Inclusion Track |
| Research Methods Track | Monitoring Evaluation and Learning Track |
| Philosophy Law and Governance | Philosophy Law and Governance Track |
| Health Communication and Wellbeing | Health Communication and Wellbeing Track |

Also added 4 missing top-level mappings that exist on disk but weren't in TRACK_MAPPING: **Education and Pedagogy**, **Thematic Areas**, **Cross Cutting Resources**, **Quick Reference Cards**. All 4 will now render with proper display names, colours, and order rather than as "Other Resources".

### Typo fix

Renamed `Handouts/Thematic Areas/South Aisa Region/` → `South Asia Region/`.

### Count correction

Catalog and README claimed "400+ handouts" — actual count is 85. Updated catalog hd1 description (400+ → 85) and 3 README references.

### Open finding (not fixed): emojis in 62 of 84 handouts

Approximately **1,000+ emoji instances** across 62 print-optimised handout files (📊 🎯 💡 🔍 etc., used as visual scanning aids in reference cards). Replacing them with inline SVGs would be ~12× the work of the dt-companion replacement and risks regressions in 8.5×11" print layouts. Flagged for explicit decision before action.

## v10.23.8 — May 1, 2026 (Flagship modules audit)

Audited the 13 flagship courses for module-count drift between the actual `id="module-N"` anchors in each course's `index.html` and the counts claimed in catalog descriptions and homepage flagship cards. 5 drifts (catalog) and 3 drifts (homepage) found and fixed:

| Course | Actual | Was-catalog | Was-home | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gandhi | 13 | 13 ✓ | 12 ✗ | home → 13 |
| Devecon | 13 | 13 ✓ | 12 ✗ | home → 13 |
| Dataviz | 12 | 13 ✗ | 12 ✓ | catalog → 12 |
| DevAI | 12 | 13 ✗ | 12 ✓ | catalog → 12 |
| MEL | 14 | 13 ✗ | 13 ✗ | both → 14 |
| SEL | 13 | 12 ✗ | 13 ✓ | catalog → 13 |

7 of 13 flagships were already accurate (POA, Media, Law, PubPol, PubChoice, Gender, plus the 3 fixed-on-one-side above had a correct second source). Lexicon term counts (claimed 50–83 across courses) cannot be verified from the static HTML — terms are loaded dynamically (Supabase). Trusting existing claims.

## v10.23.7 — May 1, 2026 (BookSummaries deep-pass)

Brand audit on all 31 BookSummary companion pages:

- **30 of 31 clean** for viewport, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth fonts, im-topbar with Browse, and no emojis.
- **dt-companion.html** (Design Thinking) had **54 emojis** across 24 unique characters (lightbulb, map, puzzle, magnifier, target, megaphone, etc.) used as decorative icons in tabs, author avatar, concept hero icons, and the toolkit cards. Replaced all 24 with inline Lucide-style stroke SVGs and added `svg { width: 1em; height: 1em }` rules so existing parent `font-size` continues to control the size.
- **Title cross-check**: all 31 catalog titles match the canonical title inside each BookSummary HTML file.

## v10.23.6 — May 1, 2026 (3 new 101-courses, 2 superseded)

### New courses

Three native slide-deck courses (1280×720 presentation format) shipped:

- **Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101** (12 sections) — SNA boundary, care economy, sustainable-livelihoods framework, agrarian question, migration, non-farm economy. **Replaces** the old `decent-work.html` and `livelihood-basics.html` (both Gamma-iframe pages absorbed into this comprehensive course).
- **Caste Studies 101** — varna and jati, Ambedkarite thought, the political economy of caste, anti-caste movements, the politics of measurement.
- **Public Finance & Budgeting 101** — fiscal architecture, Union and state budgets, finance commissions, budget transparency in India.

### Cross-references updated

- `catalog.html`: c28 retitled from "Decent Work For All 101" to "Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101" (URL repointed); 2 new entries appended (c40 caste-studies, c41 public-finance-budgeting). Filter chip 39 → 41. Hero copy 38 → 41 foundational courses.
- `index.html`: courses-modal entry for Livelihoods 101 retitled to Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101 with new URL + description; duplicate Decent Work modal item removed.
- `data/search-index.json`: 3 new entries appended.
- `sitemap.xml`: 2 old `<url>` entries removed; 3 new added.
- `_redirects`: 4 new 301 redirects so `/101-courses/decent-work` and `/101-courses/livelihood-basics` (both with and without `.html`) point at the replacement.
- Files deleted: `101-courses/decent-work.html`, `101-courses/livelihood-basics.html`.

## v10.23.5 — May 1, 2026 (Premium tools audit)

Audited the Premium tools surface against `premium.html` and `docs/faq.md` (both list 9 tools across two tiers).

- **Catalog dedup**: removed duplicate Code Converter entry — `p3` (Statistical Code Converter Pro) and `p5` (Code Converter Pro) both pointed at the same `code-converter-pro.html`. Kept the canonical title and merged the better description.
- **Catalog rename**: `p2` was titled "Qualitative Research Lab Pro" — actual product is "Qualitative Insights Lab Pro" (per premium.html marketing). Renamed in catalog and aligned the tool's own `<title>`/meta/h1 (8 occurrences) from the abbreviated "Qual Insights Lab Pro" to the full canonical name.
- **Catalog backfill**: added 4 missing premium tools — TOC Workbench Pro (live, was previously only in search-index), DevData Practice (coming soon), Visualization Cookbook (coming soon), DevEconomics Toolkit (coming soon). Catalog filter chip updated 7 → 9 to match catalog hero copy.
- **Search-index backfill**: added 2 missing tool entries (`code-converter-pro.html`, `qual-insights-lab.html`) so site search now resolves all premium tools.
- **Description rewrites**: tightened catalog descriptions for 4 entries to match the more specific copy on premium.html (Field Notes, RQ Builder, TOC Workbench, Code Converter).

All 3 tool files in `/premium-tools/` verified clean for viewport, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth, im-topbar with Browse + Premium, no emojis.

## v10.23.4 — May 1, 2026 (Labs audit)

Audited all 13 labs for metadata, brand, and link consistency.

- **toc-lab.html**: was missing the Browse link (only lab without one). Injected into the existing `top-controls` div, styled to match its local `premium-link` pattern.
- **Search-index re-typing**: 2 entries (`/BookCompanionTools/budget-template-generator.html`, `/BookCompanionTools/sample-size-calculator.html`) were mistyped as `type: lab`. They are calculators that complement book summaries, not labs. Re-typed to `tool` with category `Book Companion Tools`. Lab count in search-index now matches the 11 files on disk.

All 13 labs verified clean: viewport meta, title, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth/Inter fonts, im-topbar with Browse + Premium, no emojis.

## v10.23.3 — May 1, 2026 (Games audit)

### Brand alignment

Audited all 17 games for metadata, brand, and link consistency.

- **Emoji removal**: 14 emojis in `climate-action-game.html` (mitigation/adaptation actions + climate events) and 5 in `public-health-game.html` (cards + interventions) replaced with inline Lucide-style stroke SVGs. CSS updated so SVG sizing follows parent `font-size` via `width: 1em; height: 1em`. The platform brand standard is Sargam icons / inline SVGs only — no emojis.
- **Stale Netlify URLs in catalog**: `https://therealmiddle.netlify.app`, `https://risk-reward-be.netlify.app`, `https://cooperationparadox.netlify.app/` were pointing at external subdomains while the self-hosted versions exist at `/Games/real-middle-india.html`, `/Games/risk-reward-game.html`, `/Games/cooperation-paradox-game.html`. Catalog now points at the self-hosted files.
- **Missing topbar**: `externality-game.html` had the `.im-topbar` CSS but no rendered nav element. Injected the standard im-topbar with home/Browse/Premium links.

All 17 games verified for: viewport meta, title, meta description, OG tags, GA, Amaranth/Inter fonts, back-link to homepage, im-topbar with Browse + Premium buttons.

## v10.23.2 — May 1, 2026 (Reference Libraries audit)

### Count alignment across pages

Reference Library counts had drifted across landing cards, hero descriptions, and meta tags. Audited the 6 libraries and aligned every claim to the actual data:

| Library | Was | Now | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dataverse hero + `<meta>` | 215+ | 270+ | `data/dataverse.json` (272 items) |
| Dataverse home card | 259 | 272 | – |
| NudgeKit hero + `<meta>` + ld-json | 200+ | 203 | `data/bct-repository.json` |
| NudgeKit home card | 16 Categories | 26 Categories | – |
| Flagship summary chip | 11 | 12 | Public Choice added in v10.23.0 |
| Dataverse meta `totalItems` | 271 | 272 | actual category sum |

ImpactLex (390 terms) and FieldCases (200 cases / 117 countries) verified accurate.

## v10.23.1 — May 1, 2026 (later same day)

### Catalog → complete content index

`/catalog.html` was advertising `Games (16)` while only listing 12 in its JS array, and was missing entire content types (BookSummaries, Reference Libraries, Handouts). Now indexes **128 items across 9 content types**:

| Type | Count | Filter chip |
|---|---|---|
| Flagship | 12 | `Flagship (12)` |
| Course | 39 | `Courses (39)` |
| Lab | 11 | `Labs (11)` (was advertised as 10) |
| Game | 16 | `Games (16)` (was 12 in array) |
| Premium | 7 | `Premium (7)` |
| Deep Dive | 5 | `Deep Dives (5)` |
| **Book Companion** | **31** | **NEW** |
| **Reference** | **6** | **NEW** |
| **Handouts** | **1 collective** | **NEW** |

- 4 missing games added: Algorithm's Dilemma, Epidemic Response, Climate Action, Care Economy.
- 1 missing lab added: Gender Analysis Lab.
- 31 BookSummaries added with hand-written descriptions (no SEO boilerplate).
- 6 Reference Libraries indexed: ImpactLex, DevDiscourses, FieldCases, PolicyDhara, Dataverse, NudgeKit.
- Handouts surfaced as a single collective entry → `/handouts.html` (didn't bloat with 400 individual entries).
- 3 new card-type pill colours (book-summary amber, reference indigo, handout teal) with light + dark variants.

### Browse access from inner pages

Inner pages (13 flagship courses, 31 BookSummaries, 5 DeepDives, 4 lexicons, 3 premium tools, climate-trace-india, 76 other utility pages — **132 total**) had only a minimal `im-topbar` with a logo and Premium button. Users on a course page couldn't reach the catalog or any reference library without going home first.

Injected an `Browse` link (4-square grid icon) into the `im-topbar` of every inner page, just left of the Premium button. Points at `/catalog.html`. Inline CSS so each page's topbar look is preserved.

The homepage was deliberately left untouched — it has the full nav with Specials dropdown.

## v10.23.0 — May 1, 2026

### Public Choice — 12th flagship course

- New flagship course at [/courses/pubchoice/](/courses/pubchoice/) — *Public Choice: Decisions, Incentives & Institutions*. 13 modules synthesising the Virginia school (rent-seeking), Bloomington school (commons), and New Institutional Economics, with cases from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
- 83-term interactive lexicon at [/courses/pubchoice/lexicon.html](/courses/pubchoice/lexicon.html).
- 13 modules imported to Supabase `course_content` table (matches the convention used by the other 13 flagships: module 1 is preview, 2–13 require auth).
- Wired into homepage flagship grid, catalog filter (`Flagship (12)`), JSON-LD ItemList, sitemap, and search-index.

### Performance — measurable wins shipped

- **Extracted 215 KB of inline `<style>` from index.html → `/css/imx-main.css`.** Browser now caches CSS across navigations and downloads it in parallel with HTML. Index.html dropped from 645 KB raw / 96 KB brotli → 431 KB raw / 64 KB brotli.
- **HTML edge caching** added in `netlify.toml` (`/*.html` and `/` → `public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`). Repeat-visit TTFB fell from ~1.4s to **175 ms** (8× faster). Netlify auto-purges on deploy so freshness is preserved.
- **Auth scripts deferred** at the bottom of body (`@supabase/supabase-js`, state-manager, config, auth) so the parser doesn't block on them.

### Specials nav — accordion subgroups

The Specials dropdown was a flat list of 13 items. Now organised into 4 collapsible subgroups (all closed by default):
- **Reference Libraries** — ImpactLex · DevDiscourses · FieldCases · PolicyDhara · Dataverse · NudgeKit
- **Long-form Reading** — Book Companions · Deep Dives
- **Practice & Programs** — Flagship Courses · ToC Workbench · Dojos · Challenges
- **Behind the Scenes** — Live Projects

Single-open accordion behaviour (opening one section closes others). On mobile the cap on dropdown height was lifted so accordion items aren't clipped.

### Navigation — fixes after we found a chain of subtle bugs

- All 13 Specials items now use absolute URLs (`/#flagship-courses` etc.). Previously several used bare anchors (`#flagship-courses`, `#case-studies`, `#dev-discourses`) or relative paths (`dataverse.html`, `challenges.html`) that only worked from the homepage.
- **`js/router.js` now respects hash fragments before path-based routes**. Earlier, navigating to `/#flagship-courses` would match the home route and scroll to top, overriding the hash. Now the hash always wins. (This was the actual cause of "clicking Flagship Courses does nothing.")
- Capture-phase click handler on accordion items as a belt-and-suspenders force-navigate.
- Mobile: tapping an accordion item now closes the menu so the user can see the page scroll.
- `js/faq-bank.js` line 167 had a string-literal syntax error (stray `""`) that was killing the whole file's parsing — fixed.

### Mobile — margin safety net + Public Choice hero text fix

- Sitewide mobile (≤768px) padding floor on top-level sections, hero blocks, and the named `imx-*` sections so cards stop bleeding into the viewport edge. Tightens to 1rem on screens ≤380px.
- Public Choice hero had two inline `color: rgba(255,255,255,...)` text elements with no dark background — invisible against the page bg. Switched to theme variables; the "Boundary with Politics of Aspiration" callout uses a new `.pubchoice-boundary-strong` class with proper light/dark amber.

### Reference libraries — eliminated `on-web.link`

- `/policydhara`, `/devdiscourses`, `/impactlex` (and `/dictionary`) all redirected through `on-web.link` shortlinks. PolicyDhara was already 404'ing.
- Replaced with **Netlify Edge Functions** that proxy directly from `varnasr.github.io/PolicyDhara` and `varnasr.github.io/development-discourses`, injecting a `<base href="...">` into the HTML so relative asset paths resolve.
- ImpactLex now points at the in-repo `/impactlex/` (was migrated locally in v10.20.0).
- Updated 4 pages that linked to `on-web.link/DevDiscourses` (`index.html`, `premium.html`, `updates.html`, `content-marketing-kit.html`).

### DevEcon CSS shim

- `courses/devecon/index.html` referenced `var(--indigo)`, `var(--cyan)`, `var(--orange)`, `var(--success)` in 17 places (quiz, phase, reflection, feedback components) but never defined them. Quiz number circles rendered faint, dashed reflection borders disappeared, correct/incorrect feedback bands lost colour. Defined the four aliases in each of the 4 `:root` / theme blocks.

### Misc polish

- Catalog `.track-filter.active` failed WCAG AA contrast (sky-500 text on sky-500-at-20% background). Fixed to amber-700 light / sky-300 dark — same WCAG-safe pattern used for `.card-type.course` two CSS blocks above.

## v10.22.0 — April 29, 2026

### Deep Dives — curated reading lists from named scholars

A new content type: themed annotated reading lists curated by named scholars and practitioners.

- **5 starter lists**, each with ~11 readings across 4 themed sections, curated by a rotating mix of Sukhmeet Bedi (Editor's Pick) and the ImpactMojo Editorial team (House Pick — open to invited curators):
  - Reading Indian Political Economy — *Sukhmeet Bedi*
  - Impact Measurement: Foundations and Frontiers — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
  - Climate and Just Transitions in South Asia — *Sukhmeet Bedi*
  - Caste, Identity, and Development — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
  - Data, Power, and the Global South — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
- **Mixed media**: each list draws on books, papers, podcasts, datasets, and articles — not just academic citations.
- **Annotated, not just cited**: every reading carries 2–4 sentences explaining why it matters and how it fits the syllabus.
- **Open call for curators**: practitioners and scholars who'd like to curate a Deep Dive can pitch via [/contact.html?topic=DeepDive](/contact.html?topic=DeepDive).
- **Live at**: [/DeepDives/](/DeepDives/) · also linked from the homepage and the Specials nav dropdown.

## v10.21.0 — April 28, 2026

### Infrastructure & Claude Code setup

- **New Supabase user**: `taranga.sriraman@gmail.com` added with organization tier (highest plan), learner role (non-admin). Password reset email sent.
- **Global Claude Code setup**: Promoted 16 reusable skills to `~/.claude/` (AI APIs, platform ops, content creation, research). Available across all projects.
- **Vendored best practices**: claude-code-synthesis guides synced to `~/.claude/vendor/` with `/sync-guides` command for updates.
- **Housekeeping skill upgraded**: Added Google Analytics verification (step 11) and comprehensive branding consistency checks (step 12) covering footer, fonts, language selector, theme toggle, UserWay accessibility widget, paper plane SVGs, blob decorations, cookie consent, speed dial FAB, and SVG icon sprite.
- **Dataverse**: Added "Awesome Open Source AI" catalog (271 total items).

## v10.20.0 — April 23, 2026

### ImpactLex — full upgrade + migration home

- **Brought ImpactLex into ImpactMojo** at `/impactlex/`. The external Varnasr/ImpactLex PWA becomes a legacy reference; the live glossary now deploys with the rest of the site.
- **Unified data source** — merged the external ImpactLex glossary (35 terms + 5 case studies + 10 formulas) with the 10 course-specific lexicons (MEL, Gender, DataViz, DevAI, DevEcon, Gandhi, Law, PoA, PubPol, SEL). Deduped by term, unioned course tags. **Total: 390 terms, 5 case studies, 10 formulae.**
- **New backend: InstantDB** (evaluated against Supabase; kept separate to isolate anonymous glossary traffic from learner data). App is snapshot-first with real-time enhancement — works fully offline against the local JSON snapshot, progressively hydrates from InstantDB when configured.
- **Refreshed look** — matches ImpactMojo V3 design system: Amaranth + Inter typography, sky-blue gradient, paper-plane decoration, 3-mode theme toggle, fixed topbar, full footer. PWA-installable with service worker.
- **New features**:
  - Instant fuzzy search across term, acronym, aliases, definition
  - Category + course filters (6 categories × 10 courses)
  - Term-of-the-Day (rotates daily)
  - Deep-linkable term pages at `/impactlex/term.html?id=<slug>`
  - Bookmarks (localStorage; cloud-ready when logged in)
  - Contribute-a-term form with offline queue + moderation workflow
  - Cross-reference chips (click related terms to jump)
- **AI rewrite pipeline** — `scripts/impactlex-ai-rewrite.mjs` drafts definitions in ImpactMojo voice (South Asia–grounded, practitioner-focused) via Gemini / Grok / DeepSeek fallback chain, with a review UI at `/impactlex/review.html`.
- **Course lexicon cross-links** — every course lexicon page now shows a banner linking into the filtered ImpactLex view with its term count.
- Updated `index.html` nav + resource card, `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `README.md`, `docs/impactlex-guide.md`.

## v10.19.0 — April 13, 2026

### Book Summaries
- **3 new book companions** added (28 → 31 total):
  - *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises* — Ray Dalio (2018) — debt cycles, deleveraging, and central bank policy across 48 historical cases
  - *Handbook for IPCC Authors: Climate Communications* — Corner, Shaw & Clarke (Climate Outreach, 2018) — six evidence-based principles for climate communication
  - *Storytelling to Accelerate Climate Solutions* — Coren & Wang (Springer, 2024) — 20 chapters on narrative approaches to climate action
- Updated BookSummaries index page: hero count 28→31, filter counts (dev-econ 5→6, leadership 7→9)
- Added entries to `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, and docs

## v10.18.1 — April 12, 2026

### Fixed

- **content-marketing-kit.html** — games 15→16, labs 10→11, flagship courses 9→11 across ~20 locations including social posts, carousel slides, brand guidelines, and content calendars. Fixed carousel counts (17 Labs→11, 27 Books→28).
- **ImpactMojo_PressKit.html** — foundational courses 39→38.
- **docs/roadmap.md** — moved Cohort-Based Learning, Notification System, Sample Size Calculator, Budget Template Generator, and full accessibility audit from "In Progress"/"Planned" to "Recently Completed". Added v10.13–v10.18 release entries. Added BookSummaries expansion and native deck migration to "In Progress".

### GitHub
- Closed Q1 2026 milestone (past due, all issues resolved).
- Replied to issue #361 (skill validation workflow proposal).
- Updated issue #272 (BookSummaries target raised from 5-8 to 40+).

## v10.18.0 — April 12, 2026

### Fixed
- **Sitemap coverage** — added 87 missing URLs to `sitemap.xml`: 2 flagship courses (gender, pubpol), 35 foundational 101-courses, 23 BookSummaries, 18 blog posts, and 9 public pages (transparency, dataverse, bct-repository, challenges, climate-trace-india, portfolio, live-projects, toc-builder, verify-certificate). Total URLs: 84 → 171.
- **Stale `101.impactmojo.in` links** — migrated ~100 legacy subdomain links to local paths across `js/faq-bank.js`, `js/bookmarks-compare.js`, `js/learning-tracks.js`, `js/game-agents.js`, and 4 docs files. All course links now point to `/101-courses/*.html`, all lab links to `/Labs/*.html`.
- **Search index phantom labs** — removed 6 duplicate/phantom lab entries from `data/search-index.json` (survey-design-lab, sampling-lab, logframe-builder, data-cleaning-lab, indicator-design-lab, toc-workbench); added missing entries for design-thinking-lab, mel-design-lab, and community-lab. Lab count: 17 → 13 (13 labs + 2 BookCompanionTools).
- **Content count drifts** — fixed `docs/content-guide.md` (flagship 9→11, labs 19→11, BookSummaries 27→28), `premium.html` ("51 foundational courses, labs & games" → "48 free courses, 13 labs & 17 games"), `catalog.html` JS comments (COURSES 39→38, LABS 10→11).
- **21 `.DS_Store` files** removed from git tracking (already in `.gitignore`).

## v10.17.0 — April 12, 2026

### Added
- **Formspree eliminated** — all 12 forms migrated to Netlify Forms with email notifications to info@impactmojo.in. Platform now runs on two services (Netlify + Supabase) instead of three.
- **Engagement email pipeline** — 5-email drip sequence for new users: welcome (Day 0), first course nudge (Day 3), content showcase (Day 7), re-engagement (Day 14), premium soft pitch (Day 21). Runs daily at 08:00 IST via Netlify Scheduled Function.
- **Streak tracking** — learning streaks now increment automatically on every login and reset after a missed day.
- **Post-certificate email** — congratulations email with shareable certificate link, sent automatically when a user completes a course. Includes a subtle premium mention for free-tier users.
- **Monthly newsletter** — automated content roundup on the 15th of every month, pulls highlights from the changelog and content counts from the search index. Includes premium and one-time support links.
- **Premium sales letter** at `/premium-letter.html` — long-form conversational page explaining Premium membership, tools, and pricing. Written as a personal letter, not a pricing table.
- **Practitioner Starter Kit** at `/starter-kit.html` — curated collection of 10 essential handouts for development practitioners.
- **Branded email template** — all platform emails now use a branded template with navy gradient header, ImpactMojo logo, amber accent bar, and dark footer.
- **Resend email integration** — domain verified (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) for transactional emails from notifications@impactmojo.in. Free tier: 3,000 emails/month.
- **Notifications infrastructure** — `notifications` and `notification_preferences` tables created in Supabase with RLS policies, indexes, and auto-preference creation for new signups.

### Changed
- **Netlify form detection** — enabled form processing (was previously disabled: `ignore_html_forms: true`) and configured email notifications for all 12 forms.
- **Supabase Edge Functions** — `send-notification` updated with engagement-drip and monthly-update endpoints; `issue-certificate` updated with congratulations email and premium upsell.

## v10.16.0 — April 8, 2026

### Added
- **Accessibility Statement page** at `/accessibility.html` — formal WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance statement covering our commitment, how we test (axe-core + pa11y-ci on every PR), accessibility features, known limitations (Gamma iframes, canvas-based games, third-party widgets), and how to report a barrier. Linked from the footer Legal section, the About page, and the UserWay widget's statement link.
- **README badges** — new "Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA" shield and a live GitHub Actions status badge for the `accessibility.yml` workflow, so the repo README reflects current CI truth.
- **About page accessibility callout** — a brief paragraph in "What We Offer" announcing WCAG 2.1 AA conformance with a link to the full statement.

### Changed
- **UserWay widget** — the commented-out `data-statement_url` and `data-statement_text` config was wired up to point at the new `/accessibility.html` page. The UserWay button now surfaces "Our Accessibility Statement" as a direct link.

## v10.15.0 — April 8, 2026

### Fixed
- **Content-count drift sitewide** — `about.html`, `catalog.html` (hero + meta + filter chip), `transparency.html`, `org-dashboard.html`, `404.html`, `podcast.html`, Supabase signup/invite email templates, and four `docs/` files all now show the canonical counts: **48 courses (13 flagship + 40 foundational), 13 labs, 17 games**. Previously several of these still read 39 / 10 / 12.
- **`index.html` flagship stat line** — corrected "10 Flagship Courses" → "11 Flagship Courses" in the "What's Included" strip above the flagship course cards.
- **`catalog.html` missing flagship cards** — added Constitution & Law, Public Policy, and Gender Studies to the catalog JS data (they existed on the homepage but weren't in the catalog's searchable/filterable collection). Flagship filter chip now reflects the real 11.

### Changed
- **Learning Track Quiz promoted** — the "Not sure where to start?" quiz CTA has moved from section #6 of the homepage (below Learning Pathways) to directly under the hero area, right after the Daily Tip + Surprise Me buttons. First-time visitors now see the 5-question recommender before any content library listings.
- **New hero quiz shortcut** — added a tertiary "Not sure? Take the 5-question quiz →" link in the hero CTA block for visitors who want to jump straight to the quiz without scrolling.

## v10.14.0 — April 7, 2026

### Added
- **Device-mode default theme** on 70 pages — pages now follow your OS dark/light preference on first paint, and the 3-button theme toggle still wins if you pick explicitly
- **Underlined inline links** in body paragraphs across 74 content pages — meets WCAG 2.1 AA §1.4.1 (Use of Color)
- **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 attribution** backfilled into 17 handouts that were missing it — all 84 handouts are now uniform
- **Premium topbar link** added to 11 main-site pages
- **Language translation widget** on `climate-trace-india` and `transparency`
- **Paper plane decoration** on `courses/gender/lexicon` and `courses/pubpol/lexicon`; footer landmark on `courses/pubpol/lexicon`

### Changed
- **WCAG AA muted-text contrast** bumped across 115 files (light and dark modes both)
- **`catalog.html` card colours** (ratings + track labels) darker to pass WCAG AA
- **Theme system unified** on a single `im-theme` localStorage key — picks now carry across games, account page, main site, and handouts consistently
- **Brand fonts** — two BookSummaries pages migrated back to the canonical Inter / Amaranth / JetBrains Mono stack
- **10 unbuilt course cards** marked "Coming Soon" with a disabled amber-pill card style
- **39 pictographic emoji → Sargam line icons** across 10 pages

### Fixed
- **Handout 404s** — self-hosted with URL-encoded paths (was linking to a stale mirror)
- **Duplicate headers** on 28 pages where the `im-topbar` was hiding the main site navigation
- **121 stale `101.impactmojo.in` course links** rewritten to self-hosted equivalents

## v10.13.0 — April 5, 2026

**What changed for you:** Three 101 foundational course decks — Development Economics, MEL, and Climate Essentials — are now native HTML slide decks replacing the old Gamma.app embeds.
