# Changelog

What's new on ImpactMojo. For the full technical changelog, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) in the repository.

## v10.23.9 — May 1, 2026 (Handouts audit)

Audited the 85 handouts (84 HTML + 1 PDF across 10 top-level Track directories).

### Render bug fixed: stale TRACK_MAPPING in handouts.html

The `TRACK_MAPPING` config in `handouts.html` had **5 of 6** keys that didn't match disk folder names. As a result, only "Policy and Economics Track" was being rendered with its proper colour/order/displayName — the other 5 tracks were silently being grouped into "Other Resources" (alphabetical fallback). Fixed:

| TRACK_MAPPING key was | Now (matches disk) |
|---|---|
| Data Analysis Track | Data and Technology Track |
| Gender Studies Track | Gender Equity and Inclusion Track |
| Research Methods Track | Monitoring Evaluation and Learning Track |
| Philosophy Law and Governance | Philosophy Law and Governance Track |
| Health Communication and Wellbeing | Health Communication and Wellbeing Track |

Also added 4 missing top-level mappings that exist on disk but weren't in TRACK_MAPPING: **Education and Pedagogy**, **Thematic Areas**, **Cross Cutting Resources**, **Quick Reference Cards**. All 4 will now render with proper display names, colours, and order rather than as "Other Resources".

### Typo fix

Renamed `Handouts/Thematic Areas/South Aisa Region/` → `South Asia Region/`.

### Count correction

Catalog and README claimed "400+ handouts" — actual count is 85. Updated catalog hd1 description (400+ → 85) and 3 README references.

### Open finding (not fixed): emojis in 62 of 84 handouts

Approximately **1,000+ emoji instances** across 62 print-optimised handout files (📊 🎯 💡 🔍 etc., used as visual scanning aids in reference cards). Replacing them with inline SVGs would be ~12× the work of the dt-companion replacement and risks regressions in 8.5×11" print layouts. Flagged for explicit decision before action.

## v10.23.8 — May 1, 2026 (Flagship modules audit)

Audited the 12 flagship courses for module-count drift between the actual `id="module-N"` anchors in each course's `index.html` and the counts claimed in catalog descriptions and homepage flagship cards. 5 drifts (catalog) and 3 drifts (homepage) found and fixed:

| Course | Actual | Was-catalog | Was-home | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gandhi | 13 | 13 ✓ | 12 ✗ | home → 13 |
| Devecon | 13 | 13 ✓ | 12 ✗ | home → 13 |
| Dataviz | 12 | 13 ✗ | 12 ✓ | catalog → 12 |
| DevAI | 12 | 13 ✗ | 12 ✓ | catalog → 12 |
| MEL | 14 | 13 ✗ | 13 ✗ | both → 14 |
| SEL | 13 | 12 ✗ | 13 ✓ | catalog → 13 |

7 of 12 flagships were already accurate (POA, Media, Law, PubPol, PubChoice, Gender, plus the 3 fixed-on-one-side above had a correct second source). Lexicon term counts (claimed 50–83 across courses) cannot be verified from the static HTML — terms are loaded dynamically (Supabase). Trusting existing claims.

## v10.23.7 — May 1, 2026 (BookSummaries deep-pass)

Brand audit on all 31 BookSummary companion pages:

- **30 of 31 clean** for viewport, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth fonts, im-topbar with Browse, and no emojis.
- **dt-companion.html** (Design Thinking) had **54 emojis** across 24 unique characters (lightbulb, map, puzzle, magnifier, target, megaphone, etc.) used as decorative icons in tabs, author avatar, concept hero icons, and the toolkit cards. Replaced all 24 with inline Lucide-style stroke SVGs and added `svg { width: 1em; height: 1em }` rules so existing parent `font-size` continues to control the size.
- **Title cross-check**: all 31 catalog titles match the canonical title inside each BookSummary HTML file.

## v10.23.6 — May 1, 2026 (3 new 101-courses, 2 superseded)

### New courses

Three native slide-deck courses (1280×720 presentation format) shipped:

- **Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101** (12 sections) — SNA boundary, care economy, sustainable-livelihoods framework, agrarian question, migration, non-farm economy. **Replaces** the old `decent-work.html` and `livelihood-basics.html` (both Gamma-iframe pages absorbed into this comprehensive course).
- **Caste Studies 101** — varna and jati, Ambedkarite thought, the political economy of caste, anti-caste movements, the politics of measurement.
- **Public Finance & Budgeting 101** — fiscal architecture, Union and state budgets, finance commissions, budget transparency in India.

### Cross-references updated

- `catalog.html`: c28 retitled from "Decent Work For All 101" to "Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101" (URL repointed); 2 new entries appended (c40 caste-studies, c41 public-finance-budgeting). Filter chip 39 → 41. Hero copy 38 → 41 foundational courses.
- `index.html`: courses-modal entry for Livelihoods 101 retitled to Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101 with new URL + description; duplicate Decent Work modal item removed.
- `data/search-index.json`: 3 new entries appended.
- `sitemap.xml`: 2 old `<url>` entries removed; 3 new added.
- `_redirects`: 4 new 301 redirects so `/101-courses/decent-work` and `/101-courses/livelihood-basics` (both with and without `.html`) point at the replacement.
- Files deleted: `101-courses/decent-work.html`, `101-courses/livelihood-basics.html`.

## v10.23.5 — May 1, 2026 (Premium tools audit)

Audited the Premium tools surface against `premium.html` and `docs/faq.md` (both list 9 tools across two tiers).

- **Catalog dedup**: removed duplicate Code Converter entry — `p3` (Statistical Code Converter Pro) and `p5` (Code Converter Pro) both pointed at the same `code-converter-pro.html`. Kept the canonical title and merged the better description.
- **Catalog rename**: `p2` was titled "Qualitative Research Lab Pro" — actual product is "Qualitative Insights Lab Pro" (per premium.html marketing). Renamed in catalog and aligned the tool's own `<title>`/meta/h1 (8 occurrences) from the abbreviated "Qual Insights Lab Pro" to the full canonical name.
- **Catalog backfill**: added 4 missing premium tools — TOC Workbench Pro (live, was previously only in search-index), DevData Practice (coming soon), Visualization Cookbook (coming soon), DevEconomics Toolkit (coming soon). Catalog filter chip updated 7 → 9 to match catalog hero copy.
- **Search-index backfill**: added 2 missing tool entries (`code-converter-pro.html`, `qual-insights-lab.html`) so site search now resolves all premium tools.
- **Description rewrites**: tightened catalog descriptions for 4 entries to match the more specific copy on premium.html (Field Notes, RQ Builder, TOC Workbench, Code Converter).

All 3 tool files in `/premium-tools/` verified clean for viewport, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth, im-topbar with Browse + Premium, no emojis.

## v10.23.4 — May 1, 2026 (Labs audit)

Audited all 11 labs for metadata, brand, and link consistency.

- **toc-lab.html**: was missing the Browse link (only lab without one). Injected into the existing `top-controls` div, styled to match its local `premium-link` pattern.
- **Search-index re-typing**: 2 entries (`/BookCompanionTools/budget-template-generator.html`, `/BookCompanionTools/sample-size-calculator.html`) were mistyped as `type: lab`. They are calculators that complement book summaries, not labs. Re-typed to `tool` with category `Book Companion Tools`. Lab count in search-index now matches the 11 files on disk.

All 11 labs verified clean: viewport meta, title, meta description, OG, GA, Amaranth/Inter fonts, im-topbar with Browse + Premium, no emojis.

## v10.23.3 — May 1, 2026 (Games audit)

### Brand alignment

Audited all 16 games for metadata, brand, and link consistency.

- **Emoji removal**: 14 emojis in `climate-action-game.html` (mitigation/adaptation actions + climate events) and 5 in `public-health-game.html` (cards + interventions) replaced with inline Lucide-style stroke SVGs. CSS updated so SVG sizing follows parent `font-size` via `width: 1em; height: 1em`. The platform brand standard is Sargam icons / inline SVGs only — no emojis.
- **Stale Netlify URLs in catalog**: `https://therealmiddle.netlify.app`, `https://risk-reward-be.netlify.app`, `https://cooperationparadox.netlify.app/` were pointing at external subdomains while the self-hosted versions exist at `/Games/real-middle-india.html`, `/Games/risk-reward-game.html`, `/Games/cooperation-paradox-game.html`. Catalog now points at the self-hosted files.
- **Missing topbar**: `externality-game.html` had the `.im-topbar` CSS but no rendered nav element. Injected the standard im-topbar with home/Browse/Premium links.

All 16 games verified for: viewport meta, title, meta description, OG tags, GA, Amaranth/Inter fonts, back-link to homepage, im-topbar with Browse + Premium buttons.

## v10.23.2 — May 1, 2026 (Reference Libraries audit)

### Count alignment across pages

Reference Library counts had drifted across landing cards, hero descriptions, and meta tags. Audited the 6 libraries and aligned every claim to the actual data:

| Library | Was | Now | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dataverse hero + `<meta>` | 215+ | 270+ | `data/dataverse.json` (272 items) |
| Dataverse home card | 259 | 272 | – |
| NudgeKit hero + `<meta>` + ld-json | 200+ | 203 | `data/bct-repository.json` |
| NudgeKit home card | 16 Categories | 26 Categories | – |
| Flagship summary chip | 11 | 12 | Public Choice added in v10.23.0 |
| Dataverse meta `totalItems` | 271 | 272 | actual category sum |

ImpactLex (390 terms) and FieldCases (200 cases / 117 countries) verified accurate.

## v10.23.1 — May 1, 2026 (later same day)

### Catalog → complete content index

`/catalog.html` was advertising `Games (16)` while only listing 12 in its JS array, and was missing entire content types (BookSummaries, Reference Libraries, Handouts). Now indexes **128 items across 9 content types**:

| Type | Count | Filter chip |
|---|---|---|
| Flagship | 12 | `Flagship (12)` |
| Course | 39 | `Courses (39)` |
| Lab | 11 | `Labs (11)` (was advertised as 10) |
| Game | 16 | `Games (16)` (was 12 in array) |
| Premium | 7 | `Premium (7)` |
| Deep Dive | 5 | `Deep Dives (5)` |
| **Book Companion** | **31** | **NEW** |
| **Reference** | **6** | **NEW** |
| **Handouts** | **1 collective** | **NEW** |

- 4 missing games added: Algorithm's Dilemma, Epidemic Response, Climate Action, Care Economy.
- 1 missing lab added: Gender Analysis Lab.
- 31 BookSummaries added with hand-written descriptions (no SEO boilerplate).
- 6 Reference Libraries indexed: ImpactLex, DevDiscourses, FieldCases, PolicyDhara, Dataverse, NudgeKit.
- Handouts surfaced as a single collective entry → `/handouts.html` (didn't bloat with 400 individual entries).
- 3 new card-type pill colours (book-summary amber, reference indigo, handout teal) with light + dark variants.

### Browse access from inner pages

Inner pages (12 flagship courses, 31 BookSummaries, 5 DeepDives, 4 lexicons, 3 premium tools, climate-trace-india, 76 other utility pages — **132 total**) had only a minimal `im-topbar` with a logo and Premium button. Users on a course page couldn't reach the catalog or any reference library without going home first.

Injected an `Browse` link (4-square grid icon) into the `im-topbar` of every inner page, just left of the Premium button. Points at `/catalog.html`. Inline CSS so each page's topbar look is preserved.

The homepage was deliberately left untouched — it has the full nav with Specials dropdown.

## v10.23.0 — May 1, 2026

### Public Choice — 12th flagship course

- New flagship course at [/courses/pubchoice/](/courses/pubchoice/) — *Public Choice: Decisions, Incentives & Institutions*. 13 modules synthesising the Virginia school (rent-seeking), Bloomington school (commons), and New Institutional Economics, with cases from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
- 83-term interactive lexicon at [/courses/pubchoice/lexicon.html](/courses/pubchoice/lexicon.html).
- 13 modules imported to Supabase `course_content` table (matches the convention used by the other 11 flagships: module 1 is preview, 2–13 require auth).
- Wired into homepage flagship grid, catalog filter (`Flagship (12)`), JSON-LD ItemList, sitemap, and search-index.

### Performance — measurable wins shipped

- **Extracted 215 KB of inline `<style>` from index.html → `/css/imx-main.css`.** Browser now caches CSS across navigations and downloads it in parallel with HTML. Index.html dropped from 645 KB raw / 96 KB brotli → 431 KB raw / 64 KB brotli.
- **HTML edge caching** added in `netlify.toml` (`/*.html` and `/` → `public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`). Repeat-visit TTFB fell from ~1.4s to **175 ms** (8× faster). Netlify auto-purges on deploy so freshness is preserved.
- **Auth scripts deferred** at the bottom of body (`@supabase/supabase-js`, state-manager, config, auth) so the parser doesn't block on them.

### Specials nav — accordion subgroups

The Specials dropdown was a flat list of 13 items. Now organised into 4 collapsible subgroups (all closed by default):
- **Reference Libraries** — ImpactLex · DevDiscourses · FieldCases · PolicyDhara · Dataverse · NudgeKit
- **Long-form Reading** — Book Companions · Deep Dives
- **Practice & Programs** — Flagship Courses · ToC Workbench · Dojos · Challenges
- **Behind the Scenes** — Live Projects

Single-open accordion behaviour (opening one section closes others). On mobile the cap on dropdown height was lifted so accordion items aren't clipped.

### Navigation — fixes after we found a chain of subtle bugs

- All 13 Specials items now use absolute URLs (`/#flagship-courses` etc.). Previously several used bare anchors (`#flagship-courses`, `#case-studies`, `#dev-discourses`) or relative paths (`dataverse.html`, `challenges.html`) that only worked from the homepage.
- **`js/router.js` now respects hash fragments before path-based routes**. Earlier, navigating to `/#flagship-courses` would match the home route and scroll to top, overriding the hash. Now the hash always wins. (This was the actual cause of "clicking Flagship Courses does nothing.")
- Capture-phase click handler on accordion items as a belt-and-suspenders force-navigate.
- Mobile: tapping an accordion item now closes the menu so the user can see the page scroll.
- `js/faq-bank.js` line 167 had a string-literal syntax error (stray `""`) that was killing the whole file's parsing — fixed.

### Mobile — margin safety net + Public Choice hero text fix

- Sitewide mobile (≤768px) padding floor on top-level sections, hero blocks, and the named `imx-*` sections so cards stop bleeding into the viewport edge. Tightens to 1rem on screens ≤380px.
- Public Choice hero had two inline `color: rgba(255,255,255,...)` text elements with no dark background — invisible against the page bg. Switched to theme variables; the "Boundary with Politics of Aspiration" callout uses a new `.pubchoice-boundary-strong` class with proper light/dark amber.

### Reference libraries — eliminated `on-web.link`

- `/policydhara`, `/devdiscourses`, `/impactlex` (and `/dictionary`) all redirected through `on-web.link` shortlinks. PolicyDhara was already 404'ing.
- Replaced with **Netlify Edge Functions** that proxy directly from `varnasr.github.io/PolicyDhara` and `varnasr.github.io/development-discourses`, injecting a `<base href="...">` into the HTML so relative asset paths resolve.
- ImpactLex now points at the in-repo `/impactlex/` (was migrated locally in v10.20.0).
- Updated 4 pages that linked to `on-web.link/DevDiscourses` (`index.html`, `premium.html`, `updates.html`, `content-marketing-kit.html`).

### DevEcon CSS shim

- `courses/devecon/index.html` referenced `var(--indigo)`, `var(--cyan)`, `var(--orange)`, `var(--success)` in 17 places (quiz, phase, reflection, feedback components) but never defined them. Quiz number circles rendered faint, dashed reflection borders disappeared, correct/incorrect feedback bands lost colour. Defined the four aliases in each of the 4 `:root` / theme blocks.

### Misc polish

- Catalog `.track-filter.active` failed WCAG AA contrast (sky-500 text on sky-500-at-20% background). Fixed to amber-700 light / sky-300 dark — same WCAG-safe pattern used for `.card-type.course` two CSS blocks above.

## v10.22.0 — April 29, 2026

### Deep Dives — curated reading lists from named scholars

A new content type: themed annotated reading lists curated by named scholars and practitioners.

- **5 starter lists**, each with ~11 readings across 4 themed sections, curated by a rotating mix of Sukhmeet Bedi (Editor's Pick) and the ImpactMojo Editorial team (House Pick — open to invited curators):
  - Reading Indian Political Economy — *Sukhmeet Bedi*
  - Impact Measurement: Foundations and Frontiers — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
  - Climate and Just Transitions in South Asia — *Sukhmeet Bedi*
  - Caste, Identity, and Development — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
  - Data, Power, and the Global South — *ImpactMojo Editorial*
- **Mixed media**: each list draws on books, papers, podcasts, datasets, and articles — not just academic citations.
- **Annotated, not just cited**: every reading carries 2–4 sentences explaining why it matters and how it fits the syllabus.
- **Open call for curators**: practitioners and scholars who'd like to curate a Deep Dive can pitch via [/contact.html?topic=DeepDive](/contact.html?topic=DeepDive).
- **Live at**: [/DeepDives/](/DeepDives/) · also linked from the homepage and the Specials nav dropdown.

## v10.21.0 — April 28, 2026

### Infrastructure & Claude Code setup

- **New Supabase user**: `taranga.sriraman@gmail.com` added with organization tier (highest plan), learner role (non-admin). Password reset email sent.
- **Global Claude Code setup**: Promoted 16 reusable skills to `~/.claude/` (AI APIs, platform ops, content creation, research). Available across all projects.
- **Vendored best practices**: claude-code-synthesis guides synced to `~/.claude/vendor/` with `/sync-guides` command for updates.
- **Housekeeping skill upgraded**: Added Google Analytics verification (step 11) and comprehensive branding consistency checks (step 12) covering footer, fonts, language selector, theme toggle, UserWay accessibility widget, paper plane SVGs, blob decorations, cookie consent, speed dial FAB, and SVG icon sprite.
- **Dataverse**: Added "Awesome Open Source AI" catalog (271 total items).

## v10.20.0 — April 23, 2026

### ImpactLex — full upgrade + migration home

- **Brought ImpactLex into ImpactMojo** at `/impactlex/`. The external Varnasr/ImpactLex PWA becomes a legacy reference; the live glossary now deploys with the rest of the site.
- **Unified data source** — merged the external ImpactLex glossary (35 terms + 5 case studies + 10 formulas) with the 10 course-specific lexicons (MEL, Gender, DataViz, DevAI, DevEcon, Gandhi, Law, PoA, PubPol, SEL). Deduped by term, unioned course tags. **Total: 390 terms, 5 case studies, 10 formulae.**
- **New backend: InstantDB** (evaluated against Supabase; kept separate to isolate anonymous glossary traffic from learner data). App is snapshot-first with real-time enhancement — works fully offline against the local JSON snapshot, progressively hydrates from InstantDB when configured.
- **Refreshed look** — matches ImpactMojo V3 design system: Amaranth + Inter typography, sky-blue gradient, paper-plane decoration, 3-mode theme toggle, fixed topbar, full footer. PWA-installable with service worker.
- **New features**:
  - Instant fuzzy search across term, acronym, aliases, definition
  - Category + course filters (6 categories × 10 courses)
  - Term-of-the-Day (rotates daily)
  - Deep-linkable term pages at `/impactlex/term.html?id=<slug>`
  - Bookmarks (localStorage; cloud-ready when logged in)
  - Contribute-a-term form with offline queue + moderation workflow
  - Cross-reference chips (click related terms to jump)
- **AI rewrite pipeline** — `scripts/impactlex-ai-rewrite.mjs` drafts definitions in ImpactMojo voice (South Asia–grounded, practitioner-focused) via Gemini / Grok / DeepSeek fallback chain, with a review UI at `/impactlex/review.html`.
- **Course lexicon cross-links** — every course lexicon page now shows a banner linking into the filtered ImpactLex view with its term count.
- Updated `index.html` nav + resource card, `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `README.md`, `docs/impactlex-guide.md`.

## v10.19.0 — April 13, 2026

### Book Summaries
- **3 new book companions** added (28 → 31 total):
  - *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises* — Ray Dalio (2018) — debt cycles, deleveraging, and central bank policy across 48 historical cases
  - *Handbook for IPCC Authors: Climate Communications* — Corner, Shaw & Clarke (Climate Outreach, 2018) — six evidence-based principles for climate communication
  - *Storytelling to Accelerate Climate Solutions* — Coren & Wang (Springer, 2024) — 20 chapters on narrative approaches to climate action
- Updated BookSummaries index page: hero count 28→31, filter counts (dev-econ 5→6, leadership 7→9)
- Added entries to `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, and docs

## v10.18.1 — April 12, 2026

### Fixed
- **README.md** — labs 19→11 (separated into Labs, Tools & Calculators, and Premium Tools sections), added 2 missing flagship courses (Gender Studies, Public Policy), added BookSummaries (28) and AI Study Companions (11) to content table, replaced Formspree with Netlify Forms in tech stack, updated version to 10.18.0 and date to April 12.
- **content-marketing-kit.html** — games 15→16, labs 10→11, flagship courses 9→11 across ~20 locations including social posts, carousel slides, brand guidelines, and content calendars. Fixed carousel counts (17 Labs→11, 27 Books→28).
- **ImpactMojo_PressKit.html** — foundational courses 39→38.
- **docs/roadmap.md** — moved Cohort-Based Learning, Notification System, Sample Size Calculator, Budget Template Generator, and full accessibility audit from "In Progress"/"Planned" to "Recently Completed". Added v10.13–v10.18 release entries. Added BookSummaries expansion and native deck migration to "In Progress".

### GitHub
- Closed Q1 2026 milestone (past due, all issues resolved).
- Replied to issue #361 (skill validation workflow proposal).
- Updated issue #272 (BookSummaries target raised from 5-8 to 40+).

## v10.18.0 — April 12, 2026

### Fixed
- **Sitemap coverage** — added 87 missing URLs to `sitemap.xml`: 2 flagship courses (gender, pubpol), 35 foundational 101-courses, 23 BookSummaries, 18 blog posts, and 9 public pages (transparency, dataverse, bct-repository, challenges, climate-trace-india, portfolio, live-projects, toc-builder, verify-certificate). Total URLs: 84 → 171.
- **Stale `101.impactmojo.in` links** — migrated ~100 legacy subdomain links to local paths across `js/faq-bank.js`, `js/bookmarks-compare.js`, `js/learning-tracks.js`, `js/game-agents.js`, and 4 docs files. All course links now point to `/101-courses/*.html`, all lab links to `/Labs/*.html`.
- **Search index phantom labs** — removed 6 duplicate/phantom lab entries from `data/search-index.json` (survey-design-lab, sampling-lab, logframe-builder, data-cleaning-lab, indicator-design-lab, toc-workbench); added missing entries for design-thinking-lab, mel-design-lab, and community-lab. Lab count: 17 → 13 (11 labs + 2 BookCompanionTools).
- **Content count drifts** — fixed `docs/content-guide.md` (flagship 9→11, labs 19→11, BookSummaries 27→28), `premium.html` ("47 foundational courses, labs & games" → "48 free courses, 11 labs & 16 games"), `catalog.html` JS comments (COURSES 39→38, LABS 10→11).
- **21 `.DS_Store` files** removed from git tracking (already in `.gitignore`).

## v10.17.0 — April 12, 2026

### Added
- **Formspree eliminated** — all 12 forms migrated to Netlify Forms with email notifications to info@impactmojo.in. Platform now runs on two services (Netlify + Supabase) instead of three.
- **Engagement email pipeline** — 5-email drip sequence for new users: welcome (Day 0), first course nudge (Day 3), content showcase (Day 7), re-engagement (Day 14), premium soft pitch (Day 21). Runs daily at 08:00 IST via Netlify Scheduled Function.
- **Streak tracking** — learning streaks now increment automatically on every login and reset after a missed day.
- **Post-certificate email** — congratulations email with shareable certificate link, sent automatically when a user completes a course. Includes a subtle premium mention for free-tier users.
- **Monthly newsletter** — automated content roundup on the 15th of every month, pulls highlights from the changelog and content counts from the search index. Includes premium and one-time support links.
- **Premium sales letter** at `/premium-letter.html` — long-form conversational page explaining Premium membership, tools, and pricing. Written as a personal letter, not a pricing table.
- **Practitioner Starter Kit** at `/starter-kit.html` — curated collection of 10 essential handouts for development practitioners.
- **Branded email template** — all platform emails now use a branded template with navy gradient header, ImpactMojo logo, amber accent bar, and dark footer.
- **Resend email integration** — domain verified (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) for transactional emails from notifications@impactmojo.in. Free tier: 3,000 emails/month.
- **Notifications infrastructure** — `notifications` and `notification_preferences` tables created in Supabase with RLS policies, indexes, and auto-preference creation for new signups.

### Changed
- **Netlify form detection** — enabled form processing (was previously disabled: `ignore_html_forms: true`) and configured email notifications for all 12 forms.
- **Supabase Edge Functions** — `send-notification` updated with engagement-drip and monthly-update endpoints; `issue-certificate` updated with congratulations email and premium upsell.

## v10.16.0 — April 8, 2026

### Added
- **Accessibility Statement page** at `/accessibility.html` — formal WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance statement covering our commitment, how we test (axe-core + pa11y-ci on every PR), accessibility features, known limitations (Gamma iframes, canvas-based games, third-party widgets), and how to report a barrier. Linked from the footer Legal section, the About page, and the UserWay widget's statement link.
- **README badges** — new "Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA" shield and a live GitHub Actions status badge for the `accessibility.yml` workflow, so the repo README reflects current CI truth.
- **About page accessibility callout** — a brief paragraph in "What We Offer" announcing WCAG 2.1 AA conformance with a link to the full statement.

### Changed
- **UserWay widget** — the commented-out `data-statement_url` and `data-statement_text` config was wired up to point at the new `/accessibility.html` page. The UserWay button now surfaces "Our Accessibility Statement" as a direct link.

## v10.15.0 — April 8, 2026

### Fixed
- **Content-count drift sitewide** — `about.html`, `catalog.html` (hero + meta + filter chip), `transparency.html`, `org-dashboard.html`, `404.html`, `podcast.html`, Supabase signup/invite email templates, and four `docs/` files all now show the canonical counts: **48 courses (11 flagship + 38 foundational), 11 labs, 16 games**. Previously several of these still read 39 / 10 / 12.
- **`index.html` flagship stat line** — corrected "10 Flagship Courses" → "11 Flagship Courses" in the "What's Included" strip above the flagship course cards.
- **`catalog.html` missing flagship cards** — added Constitution & Law, Public Policy, and Gender Studies to the catalog JS data (they existed on the homepage but weren't in the catalog's searchable/filterable collection). Flagship filter chip now reflects the real 11.

### Changed
- **Learning Track Quiz promoted** — the "Not sure where to start?" quiz CTA has moved from section #6 of the homepage (below Learning Pathways) to directly under the hero area, right after the Daily Tip + Surprise Me buttons. First-time visitors now see the 5-question recommender before any content library listings.
- **New hero quiz shortcut** — added a tertiary "Not sure? Take the 5-question quiz →" link in the hero CTA block for visitors who want to jump straight to the quiz without scrolling.

## v10.14.0 — April 7, 2026

### Added
- **Device-mode default theme** on 70 pages — pages now follow your OS dark/light preference on first paint, and the 3-button theme toggle still wins if you pick explicitly
- **Underlined inline links** in body paragraphs across 74 content pages — meets WCAG 2.1 AA §1.4.1 (Use of Color)
- **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution** backfilled into 17 handouts that were missing it — all 84 handouts are now uniform

- **`catalog.html` card colours** (ratings + track labels) darker to pass WCAG AA
- **Theme system unified** on a single `im-theme` localStorage key — picks now carry across games, account page, main site, and handouts consistently
- **Brand fonts** — two BookSummaries pages migrated back to the canonical Inter / Amaranth / JetBrains Mono stack
- **10 unbuilt course cards** marked "Coming Soon" with a disabled amber-pill card style
- **39 pictographic emoji → Sargam line icons** across 10 pages

### Fixed
- **Handout 404s** — self-hosted with URL-encoded paths (was linking to a stale mirror)
- **Duplicate headers** on 28 pages where the `im-topbar` was hiding the main site navigation
- **121 stale `101.impactmojo.in` course links** rewritten to self-hosted equivalents
