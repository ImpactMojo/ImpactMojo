# Roadmap

What's coming next for ImpactMojo. This is a living document — we'd love your input. Suggest ideas in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Currently In Progress

### Vernacular Course Content
Full course content in regional languages. ([#29](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/issues/29))

**Where this stands:** The platform interface and quality-audited page translations are already live in **5 languages** — Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, and Telugu. What remains in progress is deeper course-level localisation: complete course translations refined toward human quality, starting with the most-used flagship courses.

**What this means for you:** If you work with teams who are more comfortable in regional languages, you can already switch the interface and key pages today — and full course translations are on the way.

## Recently Shipped

These were previously listed as in progress and have now shipped:

- **BookSummaries expansion** — the interactive reading companion library has grown to **55 companions** across development economics, statistics, research methods, communication, leadership, and productivity. ([#272](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/issues/272))
- **Native 101 deck migration** — all **52 foundational course decks** are now self-hosted HTML with ~100 slides each, interactive charts, and keyboard/touch navigation. No third-party presentation embeds remain.
- **Vernacular interface** — the UI and quality-audited page translations ship in 5 languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu); see "Currently In Progress" above for what's still open.

## Planned — Q2 2026 (April–June)

### For Learners & Educators
- **Analytics dashboard v2** — See completion funnels, time-on-task, and assessment scores for yourself or your team
- **Enhanced offline support** — Push notifications and background sync so the app stays updated even on intermittent connections
- **Video walkthroughs** for interactive labs — short guided videos showing how to use each lab
- **Practitioner interview series** — Real practitioners sharing how they apply concepts in the field

### Content
- Additional foundational courses across all 6 tracks
- Regional case study packs focusing on state-level India data
- **Survey Instrument Library** — Browse and adapt validated survey instruments

### Community
- **Peer review system** — Get feedback on your lab outputs from other practitioners
- **Alumni network directory** — Connect with other ImpactMojo learners

## Planned — Q3–Q4 2026

### Indian-language tools
Four open-weight models for Indian languages were released by Bodhan AI with AI4Bharat in September 2026 (speech to text, text to speech, OCR and translation across the 22 scheduled languages). Planned uses, in order:

- **Listen to a course in your language**: spoken versions of the 101 decks in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi and Telugu, generated once and cached
- **Document OCR for field material**: scanned registers, forms and government PDFs in Indian scripts turned into text you can search and analyse
- **A second transcription engine in VaniScribe**, and a free notebook route that runs the open weights so transcription needs no paid key
- **A translation quality trial** against the site's existing translations before any switch


### For Organizations
- **Certificate marketplace** — An employer-facing portal to verify credentials
- **Partner API** — For organizations that want to integrate ImpactMojo content into their own training platforms

### For the Community
- **Community-contributed courses** — Verified practitioners can publish their own courses on the platform
- **Live workshop integration** — Book workshops directly through the platform with calendar integration

### Platform Quality
- **Impact measurement dashboard** — Track real-world outcomes from learners' projects and practice

## How to Suggest Features

1. Check [existing discussions](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/discussions/categories/ideas) to see if someone has already suggested it
2. Open a new discussion in the **Ideas** category
3. Describe the problem you're trying to solve — not just the feature you want. For example: "My team struggles to track who has completed which training module" is more helpful than "Add a dashboard"
4. Include examples from your development practice if possible — it helps us prioritize
