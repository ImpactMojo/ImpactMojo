# Roadmap

What's coming next for ImpactMojo. This is a living document — we'd love your input. Suggest ideas in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Currently In Progress

### Vernacular Content
Professional translations of courses in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi. ([#29](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/issues/29))

**What this means for you:** If you work with teams who are more comfortable in regional languages, full course translations (not just Google Translate) will be available soon. We're starting with the most-used flagship courses.

### BookSummaries Expansion
Growing from 28 to 40+ interactive book companions across development economics, statistics, leadership, and productivity. ([#272](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/issues/272))

### Native 101 Deck Migration
Migrating remaining 34 foundational course decks from Gamma iframes to self-hosted HTML with 100 slides each, interactive charts, and keyboard/touch navigation.

## How to Suggest Features

1. Check [existing discussions](https://github.com/ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo/discussions/categories/ideas) to see if someone has already suggested it
2. Open a new discussion in the **Ideas** category
3. Describe the problem you're trying to solve — not just the feature you want. For example: "My team struggles to track who has completed which training module" is more helpful than "Add a dashboard"
4. Include examples from your development practice if possible — it helps us prioritize
