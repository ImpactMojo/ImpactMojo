### Added

- **Every Field Radio clip is in site search, with its transcript searchable.** The station had one row in `data/search-index.json` — the page itself — while 19 clips carrying 45,000 characters of transcript were live, crawlable and unfindable.

  `scripts/build-field-radio-index.py` generates one row per clip from `data/field-radio.json`, so renaming a clip in the manifest renames it in search. The hand-written part is a `COPY` table of descriptions and tags; a clip missing from it fails the build rather than shipping a machine-made summary, and an entry for a deleted clip fails as stale. Enforced by the `field-radio-index` CI job.

  **The rows carry no transcript.** `js/search.js` calls `initFuse()` on `DOMContentLoaded`, so `data/search-index.json` is fetched on every page load sitewide; 45,000 characters there would be a cost every visitor pays on every page. The transcripts are fetched from `data/field-radio.json` on first search instead — one copy of the text, and the index grew 12 KB rather than 44.

  **Two measurements drove the design.** A `transcript` key on the existing Fuse index matches nothing: `distance: 200` scores by proximity to the start of the field, so on a 4,000-character transcript every probe outside the opening line missed. `ignoreLocation: true` fixes it globally and moved the top result on 5 of 20 ordinary queries across the other 1,368 entries, so transcripts get their own small Fuse instance and the sitewide config is untouched. Re-measured: one top-1 moved across 23 queries, `baseline`, to the clip actually titled "Baseline design".

- **Hash deep-linking on Field Radio** (`js/field-radio.js`). `fromHash()` selects the clip named in the fragment, widens the track filter if the filter would hide it, and loads it paused. `syncHash()` uses `replaceState`, so auto-advance does not build a back-button step per clip, and since `replaceState` does not fire `hashchange` the listener cannot loop. Without this all 19 search results would have opened on whichever clip was first.

- **Two video shorts on Field Radio** (17 → 19), both on the MEL & Research track, transcribed in full and lightly cleaned: "Designing gender-sensitive FGDs and KIIs" (5:12) and "What gender-sensitive MEL actually asks" (3:39). Media streams from the `voices` bucket in Supabase Storage.

- **`rules/testing.md` item 22**, documenting the above and the two findings worth not rediscovering.

### Changed

- **`data/counts.json` gained `field-radio`**, and `docs/field-radio-guide.md` is now scanned by `check-counts.py`, so the station's clip count cannot drift again.

- **The two September clips are credited to Vandana.** They shipped under the neutral house byline used by vs-02/03/04 because neither transcript names its speaker; the attribution was confirmed afterwards.

- **`docs/roadmap.md`**: two present-tense counts were stale — the reading-companion library said 55 (now 172) and the foundational decks said 52 (now 58). Roadmaps are deliberately outside `check-counts.py`'s scope, so nothing was watching them. The planned "practitioner interview series" is recorded as shipped, since Field Radio is what it became.

## [10.245.0] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- **`DECK_BACKLOG` in `scripts/check-decks.py` is empty.** It opened on 2026-08-22 with 41 of the 52 foundational decks below the 140-words-per-slide floor; all 41 have now been rewritten and every deck clears it. The dict is deliberately kept rather than deleted — its two properties (an unlisted deck below the floor fails; a listed deck that now clears it also fails, as a stale entry) are what make the floor enforceable, and an empty dict is the correct state for them to be in. A deck genuinely mid-rewrite can be listed again, and must then come off. `docs/101-deck-standard.md` updated to match.

- **The last 22 decks rewritten to the standard**: `impact-eval`, `toc-workbench`, `logframe-101`, `pol-economy`, `research-ethics`, `feminist-research`, `data-feminism`, `gender-mainstreaming`, `wee-studies`, `care-economy-101`, `community-dev`, `bcc-comms`, `ind-constitution`, `dev-architecture`, `visual-eth`, `eda-hhs`, `irt-basics`, `eng-dev`, `edu-pedagogy`, `survey-design`, `data-viz`, `safeguarding-psea`. Method throughout: existing slide text untouched (the decks were thin, not wrong), each slide gaining a `two-col half` block — a `ctable` on one side, one or two `hbox` notes on the other — appended inside `.slide-content`. Every deck verified at `clipped=0` against the fixed 1280×720 slide box before commit.

## [10.244.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Sustainability, ESG & Corporate Responsibility for Development Practice** (`/courses/esg/`) — the **20th flagship**, and the second of the four Q2 2026 roadmap items. 13 modules totalling ~270,000 characters in `course_content`, a **63-term lexicon**, a six-question course assessment, and a capstone asking for a three-year strategy for a named company in a named district.

  **The division of labour with the 101 deck is deliberate.** `CSR & ESG 101` teaches the machinery — who is bound, what counts, what you owe. The flagship assumes it and works on what Section 135 leaves open: designing a portfolio against a real district rather than a theme, negotiating an agreement that survives a March deadline, building measurement a CFO will certify, commissioning an impact assessment that can find something, reading a value chain for the harm a company causes, and reading a BRSR properly. Four of the thirteen modules are about what a company *causes* rather than what it funds, which is where the larger effects sit and where no CSR budget reaches.

  Current to the day it shipped: the four Labour Codes in force from **21 November 2025**; the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme's greenhouse-gas intensity targets notified for seven sectors (~490 obligated entities) across **October 2025 and January 2026**; **CBAM's definitive regime from 1 January 2026**; SEBI's March 2025 reframing of BRSR assurance as "assessment or assurance" with value-chain disclosure made voluntary; and the EU Omnibus directive **adopted 24 February 2026**. Every module opens on a primary source with a working link.

- **`courses/esg/lexicon.html`** — 63 terms across 8 categories, each with a definition and a worked example, from Section 135 and the Unspent CSR Account through salience and leverage to BRSR Core and ESG rating divergence.

### Changed

- **Built to `docs/flagship-course-standard.md`, not to a sibling course** — because the siblings do not agree with each other. Part D of that document already records `intervention` with **0 SVG diagrams** and `nvc-rj` at **~4 KB per module**; measured across the DB, `key-insight` runs from 0.0 per module (`mel`) to 1.3 (`intervention`), and `social-movements`' shell carries **no CSS at all** for `stats-grid`, `key-insight` or any callout colour. The first draft of this shell was copied from `social-movements` and had to be rebuilt on `intervention`, which is the only shell with CSS for every component the standard names. A static check now confirms all 44 classes used in module content resolve to CSS in the shell, and a Playwright probe confirms each renders styled in both themes.

  Against the Part C checklist the course carries 15–29 KB prose per module, 13 theme-aware SVG diagrams, 13 licence-clean paper excerpts, **13 worked examples**, **13 reflection prompts**, **5 coach callouts** at the specified ~1-in-3 rhythm, a `capstone-timeline` with stated deliverables, and rotating callout colours. Correctly **no formulae** — the standard gates those to quantitative subjects.

- **Wired sitewide**: `data/counts.json` (courses 71→72, flagship 19→20, with 86 drifted numbers corrected), `search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `catalog.html`, `courses/index.html`, `js/offline.js`, `service-worker.js` `COURSE_URLS`, `js/course-progress.js` `COURSE_NAMES`, and the Supabase `auto_issue_certificate` course map — the last of which is server-side on purpose, since RLS lets a user write their own progress rows and trusting a client-supplied course name would let anyone mint a certificate.

- **`premium-tools` is now a canonical count.** The site claimed 9, 10, 11 and 13 premium tools on four surfaces because nothing was canonical. Every page under `premium-tools/` has a paid tier, so under the rule that anything paid is premium the count is how many ship: **13**. Added to `counts.json` with a matching pattern in the guard.

### Fixed

- **Thirteen pages were rendering with no `<h1>` in the browser, and the guard said PASS.** `js/site-chrome.js` kills `header.header` *anywhere in the document*, not only as a direct child of `<body>` — and eleven course lexicons, `Labs/toc-lab.html` and a BookCompanion tool all put their heading in `<header class="header">` nested inside `.container`. `scripts/check-h1-survives-chrome.py` modelled only the body-level rule, so it reported PASS on all of them. Measured in Chromium: `document.querySelectorAll('h1').length === 0` on every one.

  The guard now models the real kill selector — every class token in it, matched at any depth, with proper depth-counted element extents and outermost-first removal — plus the body-level rule it already had. The fix on the pages is `<header class="header">` → `<section class="header">`; all thirteen were verified to style by class, not by tag, so nothing moves.

  This is the third time this class of bug has shipped (ASER's `.foot`, NFHS's `<footer>`, and the 24 hero headings fixed yesterday). The difference now is that the guard's model is taken from the selector string in the source rather than from a description of it.

## [10.243.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`docs/teaching-and-lms-guide.md`** — one page for the person running a course: which LMS format to pick and why, what the export strips out of a package and what that means for a student's session, how Studio submissions carry identity, how the gradebook reads them, and how to deep-link a slide from a syllabus. The three pieces shipped over the last two days (LMS export, `studio-submit`, gradebook) had no instructor-facing documentation between them; `teach.html` links the tools but does not explain them. Added to `docs/SUMMARY.md` and `docs/_sidebar.md`.

- **A "For Instructors" section in `README.md`** covering the same four tools, and a paragraph on `about.html` pointing at them. Neither file mentioned that any of this existed.

### Changed

- **`docs/101-decks-guide.md` rewritten.** It described a system that no longer exists: decks "generated via Gamma", "the remaining 35 decks still use Gamma iframe wrappers", a Gamma sync pipeline with credit limits, and a deck inventory linking out to gamma.app. All 52 decks have been self-hosted native HTML since the migration completed. The rewrite lists the real 52 by track with their slugs, documents the actual `deck_builder.py` + `gen_*_deck.py` build path, and covers deep-linking and LMS export. It also names a gap the old doc hid: the five newest decks (**CSR & ESG**, **Data Protection & the DPDP Act**, **Disability Inclusion**, **GenAI for Practitioners**, **Safeguarding & PSEA**) have no Course Outline poster and no Practice Workbook, where the other 47 have both.

- **`README.md` content inventory rebuilt against the filesystem.** Its three headings read "Flagship Courses (16)", "Foundational Courses (47)" and "Interactive Studios (28)" against canonical 19, 52 and 35 — and the flagship table listed only 15 rows under a heading claiming 16. Four flagships were missing entirely (**Designing What Works**, **Nonviolence in Practice**, **Social Movements & Protests**, **Nothing About Us Without Us**), the foundational track table was a partial list under invented track names, and the studio list held 24 entries including one course and one Studio that does not exist. All three sections are now generated from what is actually on disk. Also corrected: ImpactLex "390+ terms" → **490+** (the seed snapshot holds 494) and Dataverse "296 curated tools" → **328**.

### Fixed

- **"51 foundational" was live on nine pages while canonical was 52**, including the homepage, the catalogue, the FAQ, `premium.html`, `teach.html`, `accessibility.html` and — worst — the 101 series landing page, in its `<title>`, its `og:title` and its `<h1>`. The homepage and catalogue read "71 courses (19 flagship + 51 foundational)", a total that does not add up. `upgrade.html`'s stats banner was worse still: **9 flagship, 39 101-courses, 16 games**, sitting directly beneath a paragraph that correctly said 19, 52 and 135. `about.html`'s tile row was stale in six places (70 courses, 163 reading companions, 89 handouts, 36 studios, 22 deep dives, 9 data explorers) and `catalog.html`'s in two. All corrected; `ImpactMojo_PressKit.html`'s "390+ glossary terms" with it.

- **Three blind spots in `scripts/check-counts.py` that let all of the above pass.** The guard reported PASS on every one of those numbers, which is the actual defect — a count guard that misses the site's most-repeated count is worse than no guard, because it is trusted.

  1. **The bare word.** `foundational courses` was a required phrase, but the site almost never writes it: "19 flagship + 51 foundational", "51 foundational primers", "51 foundational slide decks", "51 foundational 101 decks", "51 Foundational Courses for South Asian Development Practitioners". Now matches `foundational` and `flagship` on their own.
  2. **Tiles split across lines.** The tile matcher scans one line at a time, so `<div class="stat-number">70</div>` on one line and `<div class="stat-label">Courses</div>` on the next never met. `about.html` writes every tile that way. Now matched across a line boundary in both orders, yielding only spans on the line being scanned, de-duplicated so `--fix` cannot double-apply.
  3. **A page outside the glob.** `101-courses/index.html` is not root-level, so it was never scanned — the one page whose entire subject is the foundational count. Added to `COPY_FILES`, and `curated tools` added as a Dataverse phrase (README's wording lacked the "data" the existing pattern required).

  With the three fixes the guard immediately reported 11 further drifts, all real. `account.html`'s per-user "Courses completed: 0" tile is correctly *not* one of them — it is marked `count-ignore`, since it is a JS-filled personal statistic rather than a platform claim.

- **`ROADMAP.md` and `README.md` said the LMS export covers "118 courses".** It covers **71 courses and 47 practice workbooks**; 118 is the sum, and calling it a course count contradicted `data/counts.json`.

### Removed

- **Dead legacy nav code.** `toggleMobileMenu()` on 12 pages (`coaching`, `contact`, `data-protection`, `disclaimer`, `dojos`, `handouts`, `podcast`, `privacy-policy`, `refund-policy`, `terms-of-service`, `updates`, `workshops`) toggled `#navLinks`, an element site-chrome deletes; its only caller was the button in the same deleted header, so it could never run. Removed by brace-matching each function and confirming no caller survives outside the stripped block, rather than by pattern-replacing across files.
- **`fundamentals/capabilities.html` no longer loads `ladder-data.js` and `ladder.js`.** They belonged to a different page and `capabilities.js` never referenced them. Both wrote to `#panel` on `DOMContentLoaded`, so the correct content won only by being registered second — a latent bug had either script's loading changed. Browser-verified after removal: `#panel` still renders the capabilities content, and `/fundamentals/ladder.html` is unaffected.

## [10.242.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`/gradebook.html` — a folder of Studio submissions becomes one gradebook CSV.** Roadmap item: *LMS-friendly exports* (the gradebook half).

  **The gap was identity, not export.** The Studios already export — 33 of them do. What they export is working state and nothing else: `logframe-builder` writes `JSON.stringify(state)`, most others write `text/plain`. An instructor who collects thirty of those files has thirty documents and no way to say which student produced which, when, or from which Studio. That is the whole reason a gradebook CSV did not exist, and no amount of CSV-writing would have fixed it.

  **`js/studio-submit.js`** wraps a Studio's existing export in an envelope carrying the student's name, student number, course, Studio, timestamp and a short digest of the payload. The payload is untouched, so a submission is still the thing the student built and can still be re-imported by the Studio that made it. Adoption is two lines per Studio; **LogFrame Builder is wired as the reference**, the other 32 are not yet.

  **It is deliberately not an identity system.** No accounts, no roster, no server: the student types their own name and the instructor reads the files they were sent. The digest catches a file truncated in transit, not a student editing their own submission — and the page says so, because any scheme claiming more than that on a site with no login would be misleading an instructor about what they are looking at.

  CSV quoting is not incidental: course names like *"Sustainability, ESG, CSR and M&E"* contain commas, and unquoted output shifts every later column, silently attributing work to the wrong student. Every field is quoted and internal quotes doubled, and a UTF-8 BOM is emitted so Excel opens Indian names correctly rather than as mojibake.

- **`scripts/test-studio-submit.mjs`** + the `studio-submit` CI job — asserts an envelope carries identity, that a mutated payload is rejected with a digest reason, that a bare Studio export is not accepted as a submission, and that CSV quoting survives a comma and an embedded quote. Confirmed by disabling the digest check and watching the test fail.

### Changed

- **`teach.html`** now points instructors at the gradebook, framed as the return direction from the LMS export.
- **`js/studio-submit.js` uses an inline dialog rather than three `window.prompt()` calls** — the first version asked for name, number and course in three sequential native modals, with no way to correct the first after seeing the third.

### Fixed

- **`ROADMAP.md` vernacular entry was wrong twice over.** It read as wholly unstarted when in fact all **19 flagship course pages and their 13 lexicons** plus the homepage ship in **5 languages**; and it undercounted, claiming "30 page-dictionaries" and a "409-string" UI dictionary where the repo has **33** and **439**. Corrected, with the real remaining gap named: **0 of 52 foundational 101 decks** are translated, so a learner can browse a flagship in Hindi and hit English the moment they open a deck.

## [10.241.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`/lms-export.html` — put any course into Moodle, Canvas or Blackboard.** Builds **SCORM 1.2**, **SCORM 2004**, **IMS Common Cartridge 1.3** or a **single self-contained HTML file**, for any of the 118 courses, entirely in the instructor's browser. Roadmap item: *SCORM / xAPI package*.

  **Nothing is committed.** A package per course would be 118 zips rebuilt on every content edit, stale the moment one drifted, and heavy in the repo. The export fetches the live course page instead, so a download is always the current version. `js/vendor/jszip.min.js` (3.10.1, MIT) is the only new dependency.

  **The payload step matters more than the manifest step.** A course page carries analytics, sign-in, Supabase, translation and the shared site chrome; none of that belongs inside someone else's LMS, it would phone home from a student's session, and several pieces throw once the origin no longer matches. The exporter strips them and inlines what remains, so an imported course runs with no network at all. Verified on the generated package: no `gtag`, no Supabase, no service worker, no site chrome — and all 87 content slides intact.

  SCORM reports **incomplete** on open and **completed** when the learner reaches the final slide, hooked to the deck's own `showSlide()` so it follows real navigation including keyboard and deep links. If the LMS API is absent the wrapper degrades silently — a missing API must never break the content for a learner. **xAPI is deliberately not included**: it requires an LRS endpoint to post to, and we do not run one. Claiming xAPI without an LRS would be a checkbox, not a feature.

- **`scripts/test-lms-export.mjs`** + the `lms-export` CI job. Two failure modes here are invisible in the repo and expensive at the far end. A manifest identifier that is not a valid XML **NCName** is rejected at import with an unhelpful error — and course slugs like `101-csr-esg` start with a digit, which NCName forbids, so this is live rather than theoretical (the real package ships as `im-101-csr-esg`). And a completion signal that fires on open marks **every student passed**. The test drives the SCORM wrapper against a mock LMS API and asserts completion fires exactly once, at the last slide. Both halves were confirmed by breaking them deliberately and watching the test fail.

### Changed

- **`teach.html`** now points instructors at the LMS export, and says plainly that Google Classroom cannot read SCORM so they want the single-file version.

## [10.240.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **CSR & ESG 101** (`/101-courses/csr-esg.html`) — 88 slides, the 52nd foundational course, and the first of the four Q2 2026 roadmap items. Built India-first: Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013 and Schedule VII come before GRI or TCFD, because they are the part that legally binds an Indian company. Covers the three scope thresholds and the trap that scope is tested on **one** preceding year while the 2% is averaged over **three**; Section 198 net profit and its exclusions; Schedule VII and the MCA's instruction to read it liberally; the 5% administrative-overhead cap and the widespread error of applying it to an implementing partner's delivery costs; the 2021 unspent-money machinery (Unspent CSR Account, 30 days, three years, Schedule VII funds); CSR-1 registration and the three-year track record; mandatory impact assessment and its missing counterfactual; then SEBI's BRSR, the nine NGRBC principles, BRSR Core assurance, and double materiality.

  Written to be **taught from**, not only read: eleven sections each close with a classroom exercise, and the deck ends with a ten-question checklist for reading any CSR or ESG report. Every claim that can go stale carries its source, and the last section sends learners to mca.gov.in, csr.gov.in and sebi.gov.in rather than trusting a deck — thresholds, deadlines, forms and BRSR applicability have all been amended since 2014.

  Generated by `scripts/gen_csr_esg_deck.py` via the shared `deck_builder`, so the chrome matches the other 51 decks. The agenda slide is **computed from where the section dividers actually land** rather than hand-written, because hand-written slide ranges drift the moment a slide is added and a table of contents that lies is worse than none.

  Wired into `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `catalog.html` (c52), the 101 hub under *Philosophy, Law & Governance*, and `data/counts.json` (courses 70→71, foundational 51→52, with 59 drifted numbers corrected sitewide).

## [10.239.0] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **24 pages were rendering with no `<h1>` at all**, and three of them were losing working UI. `js/site-chrome.js` removes any `<header>` that is a direct child of `<body>` — deliberate, so the shared top bar can replace legacy per-page nav — but on these pages the heading lived inside that header, so it was deleted before anyone saw it. On three pages the block held more than a heading: the **Gandhian Lexicon**'s search box and category filter, the **LogFrame Builder**'s Import / Example / Reset buttons, and the **Public Choice lexicon**'s term counter. Their inline scripts bound listeners at parse time and the deferred chrome removed the elements afterwards, so the handlers ran on detached nodes — no console error, nothing red in CI, the feature simply not there. All four features are back.

  The fix is `<header class="hero">` → `<section class="hero">`; the class carries the styling, so nothing moved. `courses/gandhi/lexicon.html` and `premium-tools/vaniscribe.html` styled the bare `header` tag rather than a class, so those got `.lx-head` / `.vs-head` and matching CSS.

### Added

- **`scripts/check-h1-survives-chrome.py`** + the `heading-survives-chrome` CI job. It re-runs the chrome's own removal rules over every page that loads it and fails if a page's only heading disappears. This existed as a documented trap and still shipped 24 times, because the two accessibility jobs test fixed lists — **10** pages for axe-core, **19** for pa11y-ci — and none of the 24 were on either, nor would a new page be. The guard walks all 834 pages that load the chrome instead.

## [10.238.0] - 2026-08-21

### Removed

- **`instructor-kit.html`**, published earlier the same day. `teach.html` offers a kit *mapped to the requester's own syllabus*; a general public page is a weaker, different offer that quietly replaces the promise rather than fulfilling it — and it published our content gaps to everyone instead of telling one instructor honestly. Same error as the partnerships page: building the scalable thing instead of the promised thing. `/instructor-kit.html` and `/instructor-kit` now 301 to `/teach.html#kit`; removed from `sitemap.xml`, `data/search-index.json` and the pointer on `teach.html`.

  Mapped kits are written per requester in Notion instead of committed here, in an **ImpactMojo Teaching Kits** page holding a **Kits** database — one entry per requester, with Instructor / Institution / Course / Level / Status / Requested / Sent and a *Gaps flagged* multi-select that feeds the roadmap. A bespoke document per instructor has no business in a git repo: every kit would be a commit and a deploy, with nothing for CI to guard, and it could never be corrected after the email went out. Notion also gives the instructor in-line comments to reply in.

  Kits are **shared by link, never published** — each one names what ImpactMojo does not cover for that instructor, which is right in a private document and wrong on a public page. A template entry carries the house rules, including a standing instruction to check challenge tiers in `data/challenges.json` before describing any challenge as free.

### Added

- **Four roadmap items under Q2 2026**, from gaps the mapping exposed: a **CSR & ESG 101 course** (no ESG material exists; CSR appears only in passing in a few decks), a **Sustainability/ESG flagship** as the heavier alternative, **LMS-friendly exports** (gradebook CSV from studio exports, per-module deep links), and a **SCORM/xAPI package**. Recorded with the caveat that one instructor's request is not demand evidence, and should be weighed as such.

## [10.237.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **`blog/animal-welfare-and-the-fifty-rupee-fine.html`** gains a section drawing on Animal Ask's *Leverage Points: strategic prioritisation for Animal Advocacy in India* (August 2026), read from the source rather than summarised from coverage of it.

  The report's seventh priority is enforcement of existing law, which it calls "arguably ... the highest-leverage systemic reform if it could be achieved" — the same conclusion this post reached by deflating a single number. The section says so and immediately says why that is not corroboration: a shared conclusion reached twice is still one conclusion. What the report adds is specificity, so the post now names the mechanisms behind "pass the penalty revision" — making PCA offences **cognizable** (they are not, so police cannot register a case without a magistrate's order, which stops enforcement before the fine is ever reached), authorising SPCA inspectors to impose monetary penalties directly, and funding SPCAs with farmed-animal investigators.

  Two findings are included **because** they sit awkwardly with the post's own framing. On scale: ~627M layer hens, 3.4B broilers slaughtered a year, ~320M male chicks, 21–94B shrimp, 10B+ fin-fish — against which an estimated 90% of organised groups work on strays and companions, which is a corrective to writing about this subject through the courts. On litigation: the report's view that it "has overpromised and underdelivered" because judgments "arrived before social, market, and political alignment existed to sustain them" directly complicates this post's opening premise that the argument was settled in 2014, and the section says so rather than burying it.

  Also carries the report's finding that framing is "a strategic variable, not a cosmetic one" — welfare-only asks meet structural resistance where livelihoods, nutrition, food-safety or environmental framings travel — and reproduces the authors' own stated limits, including that they worked from outside India.

  Read time 11 → 16 min (1,710 → 2,473 words); search-index description and tags updated.

## [10.236.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`instructor-kit.html`** — the thing `teach.html` has been promising. A 14-week M&E teaching spine mapped to real assets, with a column for what to teach from and a column for what to set as work; a section on the studio exports that work as gradeable artefacts; assessment, licensing, and an explicit "what is not here".

  Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not claim everything is free: the practice packs are freemium (first two of four modules), and a first draft of this page said "nothing in this kit is behind a login or a payment", listed the packs as free, and used them in six of fourteen weeks. That was wrong — `practice-packs/index.html` states the terms plainly — and it was caught by checking rather than by reading back what I had written. Packs are now marked with a bullet, explained once, and the headline claim is gone. It also says outright that there is **no ESG or CSR material** and no LMS integration, rather than padding the mapping.

  All 54 internal links were resolved against the filesystem before publishing. Prices in the paid section were read out of `premium.html` and `products.html` rather than recalled.

- **An instructor-kit autoresponder** in `netlify/functions/submission-created.mjs`. The function previously acted on `product-order` and `subscription-payment` and returned 200 for everything else, so an instructor-kit request produced no acknowledgement at all — the requester waited on a promise nobody had scheduled. It now sends them a receipt with the five-working-day expectation and links to the free material, and sends a workable brief to the admin address. Adds `esc()` and `looksLikeEmail()` to that file; `looksLikeEmail` was referenced before being defined in the first draft and would have thrown at runtime.

### Changed

- **The instructor-kit form asks what it needs to answer.** It previously collected name, email, institution and one free-text "what do you teach, and to whom?". It now also asks for the course or paper name, its level (UG / PG / MPhil-PhD / diploma / professional / mixed), and a description prompting for weeks, class size and intended outcomes — which is what a mapping actually requires.

- **`teach.html` now loads `/js/form-submit.js`.** The page posted natively to Netlify Forms and never called `/api/form-submit`, so `instructor-kit` sat on the `ALLOWED_FORMS` allowlist in `form-submit.mjs` doing nothing and no durable row was ever written. A dropped notification email was a lost lead. The form now takes both paths and shows a real success state instead of Netlify's generic page.

## [10.235.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **A Sankey renderer in the Data Notes chart engine.** `DataDive.sankeyChart(mount, opts)` joins bar, scatter, dumbbell and line. Same contract as the rest: `responsive()` re-render, shared tooltip, theme through CSS classes, page-supplied data table as the non-visual fallback. Tones are semantic (`in`/`out` are money arriving and leaving). Three defects fixed by rendering it rather than reading it: middle-column labels sat on the ribbons (now a surface-coloured halo via `paint-order`), fixed 92px outer margins clipped long labels (now measured from the longest label *and value* in the outer columns), and below ~460px a 3-column flow compressed into an unreadable band (now a 460px floor inside a panning container; verified at 380px that the chart scrolls, the page body does not, and every label is reachable).

- **`barChart` and `dumbbellChart` take a `tickFmt`.** `barChart` drew axis ticks as `t + suffix`, ignoring `valueFmt`, so a dollar-denominated chart showed "+$42.45B" on its bars and "45%" on its axis — which is exactly what the first trade dive did. Ticks now follow `valueFmt` (what `dumbbellChart` already did), with `tickFmt` for axes that should be terser than the bar labels. Regression-checked against all seven pre-existing dives: ticks unchanged, no new console errors.

- **Four Data Notes**, each built from primary documents read directly rather than from press coverage of them:

  - `all-the-growth-was-services.html` — 99.2% of India's 2024-25 export growth was services; merchandise exports grew 0.08% on a $437B base. One PIB release (16 April 2025), whose subtotals tie exactly. RBI balance-of-payments figures appear in prose only and are **not** charted alongside the customs-basis numbers, because the two bases report different merchandise deficits for the same year.
  - `borrowing-to-pay-for-borrowing.html` — interest is 82.8% of new borrowing, up from 70.9% two years ago; primary deficit reconciles exactly as fiscal deficit minus interest. Its real subject is that the official rupee pie and the official budget table use different denominators, which the source states in a footnote.
  - `announced-unspent-announced-again.html` — ₹2,03,803 crore of scheme money revised away in 2025-26, concentrated in four programmes that were then re-allocated roughly the same figure. Includes a section on why the 66% fall in MGNREGS is a scheme replacement (VB-G RAM G, December 2025) and not a cut — the largest number in the table being the most misleading one.
  - `the-41-percent-that-isnt.html` — devolution is 34.7% of gross tax revenue against a headline share of 41%, because the 41% applies to the divisible pool. The divisible pool is not published, so it is inferred and labelled as inference; a ₹10,909 crore residual is shown as a residual rather than named, because the attribution could not be confirmed.

  Every dive carries the mandatory methodology block, a data table behind each chart, and linked sources. Wired into `data/data-notes.json` (which the index page renders from at runtime), `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml` and `docs/data-notes-guide.md`.

## [10.234.0] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **`partnerships.html` asserted partnership activities that nobody had agreed to.** Two facts were supplied for that page: Populi is the end-to-end research and MEL advisory partner, India Institute is the thought advocacy and measurements partner. Everything else about the *relationships* was written to fill out the page and shipped as fact about two real organisations:

  - that Populi reviews ImpactMojo's courses, labs and toolkits before release;
  - that Populi supplies anonymised evaluation cases as teaching material;
  - that readers needing paid work are referred to Populi;
  - that India Institute reviews ImpactMojo's governance, policy and advocacy content;
  - a five-point "How we work with partners" policy, including the claim that no partner has ever been given editorial approval — a statement about ImpactMojo's history with no source — plus attribution and learner-data commitments nobody had made;
  - a six-item "Ways to partner" menu of services that are not offered;
  - form copy claiming enquiries are read personally rather than queued and are always answered.

  All removed, and replaced with the arrangements as the owner states them: ImpactMojo does capacity building work for both Populi and India Institute; refers and endorses Populi for full-fledged research projects; and endorses India Institute, recommending them for measurement work — understanding measurements, tools and validation.

  Alongside that, each partner's own description of itself is quoted and attributed to their site so the reader can see whose claim it is, together with the service and programme lists those sites publish and the licence terms (verifiable from this repo). PinPoint Ventures is described in the wording already used in `about.html`, not as "founding sponsor".

  The page is roughly half its original length. Everything on it now traces to the owner or to a partner's own site.

  The lesson is narrower than "check facts": the register did the damage. Marketing prose needs claims to fill its shape, and when there were none, they got generated. Plain declarative sentences would have left the gaps visible instead of papering over them.

## [10.233.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`partnerships.html`** — a dedicated partnerships page, replacing the two blocks at the bottom of `about.html` as the place partnership is explained. Lists Populi (https://www.populi.co.in) as end-to-end research + MEL advisory partner, India Institute (https://indiai.org/) as thought advocacy + measurement partner, and PinPoint Ventures as sponsor, with each partner's own self-description quoted and attributed to their site; states the content licence; and carries an enquiry form.

  **See 10.234.0 — as first published this entry, and the page, described partnership activities that had never been agreed with anyone.**

  The form reuses the existing **`partner-inquiry`** Netlify form name and its exact field set (`name`, `email`, `organization`, `interest`, `message`). That is deliberate: `partner-inquiry` is already on the `ALLOWED_FORMS` allowlist in `netlify/functions/form-submit.mjs`, so proposals get both the Netlify notification and the Supabase row with no backend change, and they land in the same place as the ones submitted from `about.html`. A new form name would have needed an allowlist entry and would have split partnership enquiries across two buckets.

  Registered in `sitemap.xml` and `data/search-index.json` (`check-search-coverage.py` fails if a sitemap page is missing from site search). **Not linked from the site navigation yet** — deliberate, at the owner's request.

## [10.232.0] - 2026-08-20

### Removed

- **The `game-agent` LLM path, which never worked and never could.** Every AI-opponent move in the Games library POSTed to a `game-agent` Supabase Edge Function that was **never deployed**. The endpoint returned `404 NOT_FOUND`, the call fell through to the local personality engine, and the game carried on — on every move, in twelve games, for as long as the feature has existed. Nobody noticed because the fallback is good: the personality engine (cooperation bias, memory weight, risk tolerance) is what everyone has actually been playing against.

  The engine is the primary path now. `js/game-agents.js` drops from 416 lines to 317: the endpoint, the timeout-and-retry wrapper, the seven-entry `LLM_PROVIDERS` menu, `setProvider()` and `getProviders()`. `supabase/functions/game-agent/` is deleted — 637 lines of Deno that were only ever a repository artefact.

  **Nothing reachable is lost.** No page ever rendered the provider menu, no game called `setProvider`, `getProviders`, `useLLM` or `configure`, and all ten games that use the client construct it with no options — so the LLM branch was unreachable from the site even if the function had been deployed. Deploying it instead would have meant LLM API keys as Supabase secrets and a per-session cost, for a feature with no UI to reach it.

  Verified with the network stubbed to throw on any call other than the agent-data file: every game gets a valid decision from every agent, across all five action shapes (cooperate/defect, contribute, extract, bid, join/wait).

- **`econ-concepts-game.html` and `real-middle-india.html` loaded the client and never used it** — 416 lines of JavaScript fetched for nothing. Script tags removed.

## [10.231.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Certificates were impossible, and finishing a course silently failed.** This is the real answer to #960, found by running the chain end to end against the live database with a throwaway authenticated user rather than by reading code.

  `auto_issue_certificate()` called **`uuid_generate_v4()`**. The `uuid-ossp` extension *is* installed — in the `extensions` schema — while the function pins `SET search_path TO 'public','pg_temp'`, so the call could never resolve. The trigger fires `BEFORE UPDATE` on `user_progress` when `progress_percentage >= 100`, so its failure **rejected the write itself**:

  ```
  upsert 25% : OK (HTTP 201)      ← partial progress always worked
  upsert 100%: FAIL 404 function uuid_generate_v4() does not exist
  ```

  A learner reaching 100% lost the completion *and* the certificate, and `js/course-progress.js` swallowed the error. Replaced with `gen_random_uuid()`, which is core Postgres in `pg_catalog` and resolves under any `search_path`.

  The completion bar was never the whole story. It was a contributing factor — but even a learner who cleared it could not have been recorded.

- **The certificate trigger knew 9 courses; the tracker knows 20.** The other eleven hit `IF v_course_name IS NULL THEN RETURN NEW` and completed with no certificate and no error, so fixing the UUID alone would have left most of the catalogue silently uncertified. Two of the nine also carried names that disagreed with the client's — `gandhi` ("Gandhi & Contemporary Development" vs "Gandhi's Political Thought") and `poa` ("Philosophy of Action" vs "Politics of Aspiration") — so those certificates would have been issued under the wrong title. The map now covers every course id and matches `COURSE_NAMES` exactly. It stays **server-side** rather than trusting `NEW.course_name`: RLS lets a user write their own progress rows, so a client-supplied name would let anyone mint a publicly verifiable certificate for a course that does not exist.

- **`courses/social-movements/` never tracked anything.** It was missing from `COURSE_NAMES`, so `if (!courseId || !COURSE_NAMES[courseId]) return` exited before the tracker booted. Flagged in #960 and still true until now. Every one of the 19 course directories now has an entry.

  Verified after the fix, same test: `upsert 100% OK (HTTP 200)` and `certificate: ISSUED IM-MEL-2026-04BA79`. The throwaway user and its rows were deleted; the user count is back to 58.

## [10.230.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **The homepage nav's "recently updated" dots were pointing at the wrong things.** They were two hardcoded `<span>`s, added 2026-07-29 to Libraries and Field Radio and never revisited. Three weeks later they still claimed freshness, while the **blog** — which held the two newest items on the entire site, posts dated 19 and 20 August — carried none. A freshness marker with no expiry drifts in the direction that misleads: it keeps pointing at whatever was new the day someone typed it.

  The dots are derived now, from `data/nav-updated.json` via `scripts/stamp-nav-dots.py`. `nav-blog` takes its date from the newest `article:published_time` across `blog/*.html`, so the one that gains items most often needs no maintenance at all. Hand-set entries are allowed for areas with no per-item dates, and **anything older than 30 days loses its dot automatically** — which is the actual failure being fixed. Enforced in CI via the `nav-dots` job.

- **The homepage tour quoted three stale numbers.** It offered "34 studios", "163 reading companions" and "22 deep dives" against canonical figures of **35, 166 and 23**. Its other counts (70 courses, 135 games, 19 flagship, 51 foundational) were right.

  The cause is why it went unnoticed: `check-counts.py` scanned root-level HTML and the GitBook docs, and `js/tours.js` is neither, so tour copy could drift indefinitely with a green CI. The guard now scans it too — 97 files to 98 — and catches the exact drift that was there, by line. Copy is copy wherever it lives.

  Also checked and *not* a bug: the tour's `.ims-nav-btn` step targets an element that is absent from the static HTML but injected at runtime by `js/search.js`, so it resolves when the tour runs.

### Changed

- **`.claude/rules/testing.md` item 11 no longer tells you to bump the service-worker `VERSION` by hand.** It is redundant and always has been: Netlify's build command runs `scripts/stamp-version.sh`, which rewrites `const VERSION` to `v2-<commit sha>` on every deploy, so the committed value never reaches production. Verified against a live deploy where the repo held `v18-2026-08-20` and production served `v2-772296480539`. The script's own comment already said the committed value is "just a sensible default for local/preview".

- **The note about the visual-regression harness and browsers was wrong in both directions.** `testing.md` said the harness "can't run in the agent sandbox (no browser)"; a July comment on #563 said it "runs fine in remote agent sessions". Measured: Chromium **is** installed at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` and launches, but it **cannot reach the network** — every external navigation fails with `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`, including `example.com`, with or without the proxy set explicitly. So a sandbox run works against a local server only, which is exactly why the `axe-core` and `pa11y-ci` jobs pass while a deploy-preview test cannot run here.

## [10.229.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **`supabase-js` moves from 2.49.1 to 2.112.3 across the whole site.** 509 references in 509 files, plus the three admin pages that were not pinned at all. `admin/index.html`, `admin/cms.html` and `admin/bugs.html` loaded `@supabase/supabase-js@2` — a floating major that silently tracks whatever npm publishes, so those three had *already* been running 2.112.x in production while every other page ran 2.49.1. They are pinned like everything else now.

  Every changed line is a version string. The four remaining `@2` references are usage examples inside doc comments in `js/auth.js`, `js/course-progress.js`, `js/admin-cms.js` and `js/admin-gate.js`, and the 71 remaining 2.49.1 references are all under `Backups/`, which is a historical snapshot and deliberately untouched.

  `service-worker.js` VERSION → `v18-2026-08-20` and all 201 stamped pages re-stamped, since an asset-stamp change without a version bump can pair fresh HTML with a previous deploy's cached JS.

  Rebuilt on current main rather than merged: the original branch was 12 commits behind and conflicted on the service-worker version. The tree was reset to main and the substitution re-applied, so the diff is provably main plus the version change.

## [10.228.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **The six Edge Functions move from `supabase-js` 2.39.3 to 2.112.3.** Eighteen months of fixes on the library that does server-side auth, certificate issuance and push delivery. `game-agent`, `issue-certificate`, `mint-resource-token`, `send-notification`, `send-push` and `serve-course-content`; the diff is six lines, one import pin each, and nothing else.

  **This is the repository only. The functions are not redeployed.** The deploy call is not available from this session, so production still runs 2.39.3 until someone deploys. Anyone who does should run the boot check below immediately afterwards.

- **`.github/stale-branches.txt` re-audited against the actual remote.** The list held 55 branches; **54 of them no longer exist**. A deletion list that is 98% phantom is worse than none, because a dry run reports "would delete 55" and the truth is one. The remote holds four branches: `main`, `gh-pages`, `claude/supabase-js-refresh` (open PR #959), and `claude/routine-backend-upkeep` — the last of the abandoned Routine branches, whose single commit is superseded on both counts (its supabase-js target by #959, its lockfiles by main, which carries axe-core ^4.13.0 against that commit's ^4.11.4). Checked before listing it.

- **`delete-stale-branches.yml` can be triggered by a commit.** The typed-DELETE gate made the workflow unreachable from an agent session, which cannot dispatch. Editing the list on `main` now arms it, the same push-trigger route `release.yml` and `post-discussion.yml` use; a dispatch still requires DELETE typed. The workflow's own checks are untouched and still run on every branch: never the default branch, never a protected branch, and never one with an open pull request, re-checked immediately before each deletion.

### Added

- **`scripts/check-edge-functions.py`** asserts every deployed Edge Function still boots. The functions import `supabase-js` from esm.sh at cold start, and a broken import does not fail at deploy time — it fails on the next cold start, as a 500 that only the caller sees. Each probe is chosen so that passing proves the **function body ran**: the expected response is text the function itself writes, never the platform gateway's. The three with `verify_jwt: true` are probed with the public anon key, since an unauthenticated call is answered by the gateway before the code is reached; `status-alert`, which imports no supabase-js, is the control. Verified by pointing a probe at a non-existent function and by expecting text a healthy function does not write; both fail. Runs in CI on the daily schedule and on demand, not on pull requests, since it hits a live third-party gateway.

## [10.227.0] - 2026-08-20

First tagged release since `v10.79.0`. Tags had fallen 148 versions behind the changelog because nothing in the toolchain could write one; the two changes below close that, and announce the Fundamentals series.

### Added

- **Fundamentals is announced.** `.github/announcements/latest.md` now carries the announcement for the eight interactive framework pages — the Indian Wheel of Power & Powerlessness, Arnstein's Ladder, Gaventa's Power Cube, the Capability Approach, Moser's practical and strategic gender needs, the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, the Social Model of Disability, and Who Counts. Committing that file is what posts the GitHub Discussion, so the announcement ships with the release rather than waiting on a separate manual step.

- **`scripts/check-viewport.py`** enforces the viewport rule that `.claude/rules/testing.md` has stated since the file existed and nothing checked. Without `<meta name="viewport">` a phone lays the page out at desktop width and zooms out; the page looks correct on the machine it was built on, and only a visitor on a phone ever sees the difference. All 859 pages pass today, with the five Supabase email templates exempted for the recorded reason that a mail client ignores viewport. Enforced in CI via the `viewport` job.

  The guard tolerates `name=viewport` unquoted and `content=` written before `name=`, because both shapes exist in this repo and both defeat a naive scan. That matters: an ad-hoc check of mine reported two reading companions as missing a viewport when they had one all along, written unquoted and past the byte cut-off the check happened to read. **No page was broken; the finding was wrong and the edit it prompted has been reverted.** The guard was then re-verified by removing a real tag rather than the redundant one, which is the test that would have caught the mistake the first time.

### Changed

- **The release workflow can now be triggered by a commit.** `workflow_dispatch` returns 403 from an agent session, exactly as tag pushes do, so a release could be written and still never cut — the failure this workflow existed to fix, reappearing one level up. Committing a version to `.github/release/VERSION` now cuts that release, the same push-trigger route `post-discussion.yml` already uses for Discussions. A dispatch still previews by default; a push publishes, because committing a version is the deliberate act. A push naming an already-released version is a no-op rather than a red run. All eight paths (missing stamp, malformed stamp, `v`-prefixed stamp, unknown version, duplicate version, empty section, dispatch preview, dispatch publish) were simulated against the real changelog before the workflow could run.

## [10.226.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **127 live pages were in the sitemap and missing from site search.** The sitemap is what we tell Google exists; `data/search-index.json` is what our own visitors can find. They had drifted 127 pages apart: **47 course posters, 19 reading companions, 17 course lexicons, 8 premium tools**, and 36 others including `verify-certificate`, `toc-builder`, `podcast`, `testimonials` and the whole legal set. Every one of them was live, crawlable and advertised to search engines, and typing its name into the site's own search returned nothing.

  Nothing failed to make this happen. Adding a page updates `sitemap.xml`; the index is a separate file nobody is forced to touch, so the gap widened one page at a time for months.

  Titles, descriptions and tags are taken from each page's own `<title>` and `meta description` rather than written fresh, and each entry inherits its tags from the already-indexed sibling with the same slug, so a poster carries its course's tags. Six pages had no description at all and were written by hand. Five pages are deliberately left out, each with its reason recorded in the guard: the homepage, the `/handouts` pretty-URL duplicate, a post-transaction thank-you page, a dev-setup artefact, and a 16KB alternate rendering of a course already indexed under the same title.

  Two measurement traps on the way: comparing raw URL strings reports **87 phantom gaps**, because the index stores `%20` in handout paths and the sitemap does not; and resolving the lowercased paths against a case-sensitive filesystem reports **24 sitemap 404s that do not exist**. Both were my own errors, caught by checking rather than by anything failing. There are no 404s in the sitemap.

- **Seven poster pages had a double-escaped `meta description`.** `&amp;mdash;` where `&mdash;` was meant, and `social-margins.html` was escaped three deep (`&amp;amp;mdash;`). These render as literal `&mdash;` text in Google results and social cards, which is the one place a meta description is ever seen. Only the surplus layers are stripped, leaving exactly one valid entity; a real ampersand (`M&amp;E`) cannot match, because the pattern requires a named entity immediately after.

### Added

- **`scripts/check-search-coverage.py`** asserts every `sitemap.xml` page is in the search index, comparing decoded, case-folded, fragment-stripped paths. Exemptions live in the script with a written reason, and a **stale exemption is itself a failure** — if an exempted page later gets indexed, or leaves the sitemap, the guard says so, so the list cannot rot into a permanent blindfold. Verified by reintroducing the bug three ways: removing an indexed entry fails, exempting an indexed page fails as stale, and the restored state passes. Enforced in CI via the `search-coverage` job.

- `showcase` and `special` now have proper labels and icons in `js/search.js`. Both types already existed in the index and fell through to a badge reading the raw type name.

- **The release workflow now refuses a duplicated version instead of guessing.** `CHANGELOG.md` carried **two `## [10.210.0]` sections** — the form-submission fix and the Capability Approach page, both dated 2026-08-19. The workflow resolved a version with `findIndex`, so releasing 10.210.0 would have published whichever section came first, with half the notes and no warning. It now fails on more than one match, and the newer of the two entries is renumbered `10.210.1`. Found by asserting uniqueness while resolving an unrelated merge conflict, not by anything failing.

## [10.225.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **A workflow that can actually cut a release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Tags on this repo had drifted to `v10.79.0` while the changelog was at 10.224.0 — 153 changelog sections against 7 tags — because nothing in the toolchain could write one. A tag push is rejected 403 both through the session proxy and through a direct PAT, and the GitHub MCP server has no create-release tool, so every release since v10.79.0 was silently skipped rather than refused.

  The workflow runs on GitHub with its own token, reads the notes out of `CHANGELOG.md` rather than restating them, and tags whatever the default branch points at when it runs. Dry-run by default: the first click prints the tag, the commit and the notes to the job summary without creating anything. It refuses a version with no section in the changelog, refuses an empty section, and refuses a tag that already exists. Parser verified against the real file: 153 sections, correct boundaries, no bleed into the next entry.

## [10.224.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Blog: "Designing an Impact Evaluation: Eight Steps, and When to Take Them"** (`/blog/designing-an-impact-evaluation.html`, Methods, ~1,360 words). Built from an eight-step impact-evaluation guidance deck, but argued rather than summarised: the steps are drawn as a sequence, and the sixth of them, the counterfactual, is a constraint set by how the programme rolls out rather than a stage the evaluator reaches. Covers what that changes about rationale, unit of variation, theory of change and budget; the three rollout situations and what each permits (randomised phase-in, eligibility thresholds, universal entitlement); and planning dissemination for a null result. Indexed, in the sitemap, carded on `blog.html` with an inline SVG rather than a missing image file.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/check-social-images.py` skipped every reference written without the `www.`** It compared each URL against a single origin string, `https://www.impactmojo.in`, and treated anything else beginning with `http` as an external host that is somebody else's problem. `nfhs.html` pointed `og:image` at `https://impactmojo.in/assets/og-default.png` — a file that does not exist — and the missing four characters were enough for the guard to wave it through. The page has been sharing with no preview image, and the guard that exists to catch exactly that reported PASS.

  It now recognises all four spellings of our own origin (`http`/`https` × with/without `www.`), which raises the number of images actually checked from 1,168 to 1,171, and `nfhs.html` now points at a real file.
## [10.223.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **Course progress now gives partial credit, and a module passes on a majority.** Two changes to `js/course-progress.js`, both prompted by a diagnosis that turned out to be wrong.

  A module used to require a clean sweep — every graded question correct. MEL delivers 12 modules of 4 questions, so finishing it meant 48 correct answers with no allowance for a single question that reads badly. `PASS_RATIO` is now 0.75: 3 of 4, 2 of 2, 5 of 6. MEL's bar falls from 48 to 36.

  Progress was also all-or-nothing inside a module: the figure written to `user_progress` was `completedModules / totalModules`, which moves only when a whole module lands, so a learner three questions in had nothing on their account page and we could not see where people stop. Each module now contributes a fractional score capped at 1, and a correct answer syncs immediately rather than waiting for the module to finish (`queueSync` already debounces 3s, so a run of quick answers is still one write). One correct answer in MEL now reads 3% instead of 0%.

  **Completion semantics are unchanged.** 100% is still reachable only when every module has passed, which is what the `on_course_completed` trigger keys on. Verified against MEL's real shape: 11 of 12 modules gives 92%, every module at exactly the pass mark gives 100%, and eleven modules complete with one at 2 of 4 does **not** reach 100%.

### Corrected

- **The #960 diagnosis was substantially wrong, and is retracted here.** I read the static HTML of the course pages, found all six graded questions inside `<section id="course-assessment">` and none in the module sections, and concluded that `scanModules()` found nothing, `totalModules` stayed 0, and the tracker never booted for any learner.

  Module bodies are not in the HTML. They are injected at runtime by `js/course-loader.js` from the `course_content` table, which holds 246 modules across 19 courses — **202 with `quiz_html`, 186 of those graded**. Asking the live endpoint for MEL returns 14 modules, none locked even for an anonymous visitor, 12 of them carrying 4 graded questions each inside the correct module section. The tracker boots, the quizzes are wired, and the handshake between loader and tracker works in both directions.

  What remains true is only the measurement: `user_progress` has 0 rows ever inserted against 17,022 reads, and `certificates` 0 ever, with 54 signed-in users. The likeliest explanation is now the ordinary one — a demanding completion bar that nobody has cleared — which is what the two changes above address. A browser check while signed in would settle it.

  Recorded rather than quietly amended, because the wrong diagnosis was detailed and confident enough to have justified writing roughly 663 quiz questions that already existed.
## [10.222.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **33 paid product pages were absent from site search.** Every one is live, ungated and priced — the four ₹499 assessment banks, the ₹99 checklists, the ₹199 budget template, the workbooks, refreshers, posters and templates. They were in `sitemap.xml`, so Google could find them, but ImpactMojo's own search could not: someone already on the site looking for "logframe" or "field readiness checklist" got nothing.

  Entries are generated from each page's own `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` rather than written by hand, so they cannot drift from the page. A description that opened by restating the title is trimmed, since that wastes the whole search snippet. Categories are derived from the slug (Assessment Banks 4, Templates 11, Workbooks 4, Refreshers 4, Checklists 3, Toolkits 3, Decks 2, Posters 2), and each entry carries its price as a tag.

  1,087 → 1,120 entries. Verified after writing: valid JSON on re-read, no duplicate id or URL anywhere in the file, no entry missing a required field, and **all 33 URLs resolve to a real `index.html`**. The sitemap-not-indexed gap falls from 162 to 129; the only `/products` path still outside search is `/products.html` itself, which is the listing page and already has an anchor entry.

## [10.221.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **`scripts/check-supabase-writes.py` — a guard for the class of bug that hid the dead progress sync.** `supabase-js` *resolves* with `{ data, error }` rather than throwing, so `await sb.from('t').upsert({...})` reports a rejected write exactly as it reports a successful one, and any `try/catch` around it can never fire. That is how `user_progress` reached 0 rows ever inserted against 17,022 reads without anyone noticing (#960).

  The static half runs on every push and needs no credentials: it finds every `.from('table')` chained to a mutating verb and fails when the result is discarded, or captured and never checked. It accepts the three legitimate shapes — `var { error } = await …`, `var res = await …` followed by a read of `res.error`, and `.then(cb)` where `cb` inspects `.error` — and a line may opt out with `write-ignore`.

  The live half (`--live`, scheduled only, skips gracefully without `SUPABASE_PAT`) asserts that every table the code writes to has a non-zero `n_tup_ins`. A table with a writer that has never received a row is either broken or never wired to a UI; both are worth knowing, and neither should be silent.

### Fixed

- **Nine Supabase writes could fail without any trace**, found by the new guard and fixed:
  - `js/course-progress.js` — the `user_progress` upsert behind #960, whose `catch` carried the comment "Silently fail".
  - `account.html` — notification preferences showed **"Saved"** unconditionally, a false success of exactly the kind the form rebuild removed elsewhere; and marking a notification read.
  - `admin/index.html` ×2 — feature flags and site metadata saved with no confirmation that anything was written.
  - `org-dashboard.html` ×2 — deleting a discussion post, and the "fire-and-forget" upsert that makes an organisation's creator a member, where a failure leaves the creator outside their own org.
  - `portfolio.html` — the portfolio headline update.
  - `js/auth.js` — `last_active_at` recorded the day in `localStorage` inside a `.then` that ran even on failure, so a failed write suppressed its own retry for the rest of the day.

### Notes on building the guard

Three defects in the guard and its own tooling were caught by testing rather than reading, all of them the guard-passes-anyway failure mode:

- The first regex backtracked catastrophically and **hung** on a long line. A hung CI job neither passes nor fails — it reads as "still running", the exact failure this repo already documents. Replaced with a bounded linear scan.
- Reformatting a call across several lines made the single-line matcher **go blind to it**: the detected count silently fell from 17 to 13, and the guard "passed" partly because it had stopped looking. Now matched across the whole file text, which also surfaced four writes the first version never saw at all — including one in `js/auth.js`. A false positive was fixed the same way: `portfolio.html` checks `result.error` inside a `.then` callback, which the first classifier did not understand.
- **The script that added this entry silently did nothing.** It used `str.replace()` against an anchor that did not exist on the branch, with no assertion, so the entry was never written and nothing reported it — the same shape as the bug the entry describes. The anchor is now asserted before the write.

## [10.219.1] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **Seven open dependabot PRs cleared by applying their bumps on current main** rather than merging seven branches cut between 6 July and 17 August, each of which would have needed rebasing in turn over the same lockfile: `actions/checkout` v4 → v7 (the 2 files still on v4; 25 uses were already v7, #793), `actions/setup-node` v6 → v7 (#839), `actions/setup-python` v6 → v7 (#840), `actions/github-script` v7 → v9 (#930), `axe-core` and `@axe-core/puppeteer` → ^4.13.0 (#931, #932), `@axe-core/cli` → ^4.12.1 (#672). #671 (puppeteer 24.43.1 → 25.3.0) was closed as obsolete — main was already on ^25.7.0. The lockfile was regenerated with `npm install --package-lock-only`, and the full CI suite passed **on the new action versions**, which is the actual verification.

  One gap CI cannot cover: `actions/github-script` v9 is used only in `delete-stale-branches.yml`, which runs on manual dispatch. Its script uses `github.rest.*`, `core.info` and `context.repo`, unchanged across v7…v9, so the jump is a runner-version bump — but the next branch cleanup will be its first real run on v9.

## [10.219.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **The wiki was advertising counts nobody was checking.** `.github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml` refreshed exactly two hardcoded phrases — foundational courses and native decks — on three of the wiki's eleven pages. Every other number on the wiki drifted unread. The Book-Summaries page still said 163 reading companions and the Premium page still said "135 games, 34 labs, 163 BookSummaries, 22 Deep Dives, 89 handouts" against a canonical 166/35/23/90.

  `scripts/check-counts.py` gains `--wiki DIR`: it scans a wiki clone's `*.md` with the same canonical table it already enforces on the site, skipping `Changelog.md` and `Roadmap.md` for the same reason the repo's own changelog and roadmap are skipped. The sync workflow now runs it with `--fix` and then again as a check, replacing the two-phrase `sed`. `data/counts.json` joins the workflow's trigger paths, so a count change reaches the wiki rather than waiting for the next changelog edit.

  Two matcher changes came out of testing it. `BookSummaries` is now a recognised label for `reading-companions` — the site's other name for the same library, and the one carrying the stale 163. And a number that looks like a year is no longer read as a count when the canonical value is not itself year-shaped: "the Q3 2026 BookSummaries expansion" matched as 2026 reading companions, and `--fix` would have written "Q3 166 BookSummaries" into the wiki.

- **The visual-regression harness for #563 listed a page that has never existed.** `tests/visual/visual-regression.spec.js` screenshots `/cookies.html`; there is no such file in the repo and no redirect to one. `page.goto()` was not checking the response, so the first baseline run would have captured the 404 page and compared against it happily ever after — the gate for the `@layer` migration passing while testing nothing. The navigation now asserts a sub-400 status, and the dead entry is replaced with `/nfhs.html`.

### Changed

- **The #563 harness now covers the whole blast radius.** `css/imx-main.css` is loaded by exactly two pages: `index.html` (minified) and `nfhs.html`. Every other page carries its own inline `<style>` and links only `css/fonts.css`. The harness covered one of the two and a 404; it now covers both, with the other seven pages kept as controls that must not move.

## [10.218.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Two distinct live pages both presented themselves as "Theory of Change Workbench."** `Labs/toc-lab.html` carried that name in its `<title>`, `<h1>`, `og:title`, `twitter:title`, JSON-LD and its canvas export watermark — while every link pointing at it (`catalog.html`, `Labs/index.html`, `README.md`) called it **Theory of Change Studio**, and a separate live page, `toc-workbench.html`, is the actual Workbench. Clicking "Studio" landed on a page headed "Workbench". Renamed across all nine occurrences, and its boilerplate social description ("free development education from ImpactMojo. Browse courses, games, labs…") replaced with one describing the tool.

- **`data/search-index.json` returned the same lab twice.** Two entries pointed at `/Labs/toc-lab.html`: `LAB-TOC` ("Theory of Change Studio", type `lab`) and `toc-workbench` ("Theory of Change Workbench", type `tool`). Both descriptions matched the lab; the second was a duplicate carrying the name of a different page. Removed, keeping the lab-typed entry so the 35-lab count still reconciles. 1,088 → 1,087 entries, and no URL now appears twice.

### Changed — repo hygiene

- **The last nine `claude/` branches are queued for deletion.** Six had been queued on 2026-08-16 and were never actioned: the cleanup workflow last ran that morning, at a commit that predated PRs #928 and #929 adding them. The three remaining were audited now and added.

  The audit needed a full clone. This session's checkout is shallow (71 commits), which made every `rev-list --left-right` comparison report 1,700–2,300 commits "ahead" and every `merge-base` come back empty — numbers that look like unmerged work and are not. After `--unshallow`:

  - `marginalia-essay-images` — one commit; all ten essay images and the text are on main via #926.
  - `impactmojo-updatable-components` — 22 commits, almost all the Telugu docs, which landed via #927 (54 files on the branch, 54 on main). Of its 77 files main lacks, **76 existed at the merge base and were deleted from main deliberately** — the branch only preserves the old state. The 77th, `docs/updatable-components.md`, is the one thing it created that never landed; it is deliberately not salvaged (count table audited 2026-07-06 and stale, structure duplicated by `docs/content-guide.md` and `docs/content-catalog.md`, ripple checklist duplicated by `.claude/rules/content-management.md`).
  - `routine-backend-upkeep` — one dependency refresh main has overtaken (branch pins puppeteer ^24.43.1, main is on ^25.7.0).

  **Deletion still needs one human click**: Actions → "Delete stale branches" → Run workflow → type `DELETE`. Neither a session PAT nor the GitHub App can dispatch a workflow (403 `Resource not accessible by integration`), which is why the workflow exists in this form.

### Noted, not changed

- **161 pages are in `sitemap.xml` and not in the search index.** A first count said 183 and then 248; both were wrong, because handouts are indexed under URL-encoded paths (`%20`) and the comparison decoded only one side — the same trap `scripts/check-social-images.py` documents. Corrected, the 161 break down as 48 `101-courses` poster/native/practice variants, 19 `BookSummaries` `-interactive` variants, 17 course sub-pages, 8 gated `premium-tools`, 23 root pages (mostly legal and utility) and 33 `products`. Most of those exclusions are deliberate, so no guard was added and nothing was mass-indexed: which of these should be findable is a content decision, not a defect list.

## [10.217.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Fundamentals: The Social Model of Disability** (`/fundamentals/social-model.html`) — the eighth framework, completing the three added this week. The impairment/disability distinction is UPIAS's, from the *Fundamental Principles of Disability* (1976); Michael Oliver named the model (1983) and developed it in *The Politics of Disablement* (1990); **Anita Ghai** is credited for the Indian critique, which the page uses rather than mentions.

  **Its own diagram form: the barrier stack.** A person at the foot, an outcome at the head, and four bands between them whose width is how much of the way each barrier blocks — with a clear channel on the right for what gets through. Bands are ordered widest first, because the question the stack exists to answer is which layer blocks most. Every band is clickable for the barrier's detail.

  Six stacks: entering a public building, boarding a bus, finishing school, getting a job, being counted, and holding the certificate. Each carries all four barrier kinds — attitudinal, environmental, institutional, communication.

  **21 sourced evidence entries**, from the NSS 76th Round's disability module (2018) and the statute:

  - **43.6%** of persons with disability accessed a public building in a year (men 48.2%, women 37.3%); **63.9%** of those who did faced difficulties.
  - **58.1%** used public transport; **67.1%** of those faced difficulties — and the rate barely differs by sex (66.7% men, 67.8% women), which points at the vehicle rather than at who is boarding it.
  - **14.9%** of rural persons with disability aged 15+ completed secondary education or above, against 31.0% urban — and **8.2%** for rural women. Literacy is 52.2% overall and 33.3% for rural women.
  - Prevalence is **2.2%**, and **2.4% for men against 1.9% for women**, which is hard to explain biologically in a population where women live longer and easier to explain by who gets reported.

  Plus RPwD Act 2016 ss. 2(r), 16, 32, 34, 44–46, 57 and 58 and the Schedule; *Rajive Raturi v Union of India* (2017); *Vikash Kumar v UPSC* (2021); and the Accessible India Campaign.

  The page states plainly what the model does not claim — that impairment is unreal, or that pain is socially produced, a misreading Oliver spent later years rejecting — records Shakespeare's objection that a model built to look away from the body can end up unable to discuss it, and gives Ghai's argument its own paragraph: a model developed against a functioning welfare state assumes a state that has already promised access, and where services are thin for everyone the line between a barrier faced because of disability and one faced because of poverty is not clean.

  One entry was **dropped rather than published**: NSS 76th Round indicator 8 is titled "advised aid/appliances **and** acquired aid/appliances" and returns a single value per cell, so whether 22.2% means advised, acquired, or both cannot be determined from the API. The metadata does not disambiguate it, so it is not on the page.

### Changed — guards

- `scripts/check-diagram-contrast.py` gains the eighth renderer. **No new label-colour section was needed**: every label in this diagram sits on a coloured band rather than on the page ground, so the renderer's own ink chooser covers all of them. The two pages before this one each needed a theme-aware ink added after the fact; this one avoids the class rather than fixing it a third time.

## [10.216.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Fundamentals: The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework** (`/fundamentals/livelihoods.html`) — the seventh framework. DFID's *Sustainable Livelihoods Guidance Sheets* (1999), formalising Chambers and Conway's argument (IDS Discussion Paper 296, 1992) and given its analytical shape by Scoones (IDS Working Paper 72, 1998). All three are credited.

  **Its own diagram form: the asset pentagon, drawn eight times.** The framework's claim is that the shape matters more than the total, so the page leads with small multiples — all eight livelihoods to the same scale, side by side — and shows the selected one at size beside its detail. A single chart would have hidden the argument. Each case carries a vulnerability context split into shocks, trends and seasonality, and a note on the structures and processes that decide what its assets are worth.

  The eight: a marginal farmer, a landless labourer, a large landholder (as the contrast case), a forest-dwelling household, a pastoralist, a small-scale marine fisher, a seasonal migrant worker and a home-based worker.

  **20 sourced evidence entries**, most of them new to the site, from the NSS 77th Round:

  - An average agricultural household earns **₹4,063 a month from wages against ₹3,058 from crop production** — total ₹8,337, of which farming is under half. The households agriculture defines earn more from selling labour than from farming.
  - **70.4%** of agricultural households possess one hectare or less; **0.37%** possess more than ten.
  - For households under 0.01 ha, **50.3%** of outstanding credit is owed to professional moneylenders and 13.5% to commercial banks. For households over 10 ha those figures are 5.2% and **55.8%**. Land is what buys access to the banking system, which is the sharpest statement of the framework's central claim available in Indian data.
  - Wage income falls as landholding rises — ₹5,400 a month for ST households with almost no land, ₹2,081 for those with over ten hectares.

  Plus the Forest Rights Act 2006 (ss. 3(1)(c), 3(1)(d) and 3(1)(e), the last recognising transhumant grazing and nomadic communities specifically), *Orissa Mining Corporation v MoEF* (2013), MGNREGA, the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act 1979, ONORC, and the state Marine Fishing Regulation Acts.

  The page states where the framework is contested: that five neutral-sounding capitals can be drawn for a landlord and for the labourer on that land without showing that one is the reason for the other; that treating credit as an asset is a category error at distress rates, which this page's own evidence demonstrates; and that a pentagon is a stock rather than a direction, so an accumulating and a liquidating household look identical.

### Changed — guards

- `scripts/check-diagram-contrast.py` gains the new renderer and an `AXIS_LABELS` section. The pentagon names each axis beside the chart, on the page ground rather than on any fill — **all five capital colours fail AA on the dark ground**, the same trap the gender-needs quadrant labels fell into a version earlier. They take theme-aware inks, checked against both grounds.

### Fixed

- Two label-clipping bugs in the pentagon, caught by measuring rather than by looking: `FINANCIAL` and `SOCIAL` sit at the widest points of a pentagon and are the two longest words, so a square viewBox clipped both. The labelled chart is now wider than it is tall.

## [10.215.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Fundamentals: Practical and Strategic Gender Needs** (`/fundamentals/gender-needs.html`) — the sixth framework, and the first gender-analysis lens in the series. The distinction is Caroline Moser's, from *World Development* 17(11) (1989) and *Gender Planning and Development* (1993), built on Maxine Molyneux's separation of practical from strategic interests (*Feminist Studies* 11(2), 1985). Molyneux is credited on the page, since the attribution is usually dropped.

  Its own diagram form, as the other five have: a square two-axis plot rather than a list, because the useful part of the distinction is not the two categories but where a real intervention falls between them. Each of twelve Indian cases sits at **relief** (how much material burden it lifts, judged by use rather than by what was distributed) against **shift** (how far it moves the division of labour, assets or authority). The four quadrants are named and glossed under the plot. Both scores are ImpactMojo's and both are stated to be arguable, with the evidence for each printed under the point.

  **22 sourced evidence entries.** The anchor pair is MoSPI's Time Use Survey 2024: Indian women spend **305 minutes a day** on unpaid activity against men's **56**, and **62 minutes** on paid activity against men's **251**. Also drawn on: PLFS 2023-24 (female LFPR 41.7%, 47.6% rural against 28.0% urban, male 78.8%); NFHS-5 asset ownership (31.7% of women own land alone or jointly against 42.3% of men; 42.3% own a house against 60.1%); NFHS-5 household decision-making (88.7%, which set against the land figure is participation without control); MoSPI Gender Statistics on Panchayati Raj representation as on 06.01.2025 (Andhra Pradesh 55.47%, Assam 54.73%, Bihar 52.02%); NFHS-4 spousal violence (33.3%); NSS 78th Round on water; and the statutes and judgments — Article 243D, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005 with *Vineeta Sharma v Rakesh Sharma* (2020), PWDVA 2005 s.17, the POSH Act 2013 with *Vishaka* (1997), the Maternity Benefit Act as amended 2017, and MGNREGA 2005.

  The page states plainly where the framework is contested: that it is read as a hierarchy with strategic work treated as the real feminism, that the two are not cleanly separable in practice, and that "women's interests" is not one thing — pointing the reader at the Wheel of Power for the divisions a two-axis plot cannot show.

### Fixed

- **The Fundamentals index and every sibling page** now link the new framework, and the series navigation carries it.

### Changed — guards

- `scripts/check-diagram-contrast.py` gains the new renderer and a `QUAD_LABELS` section. The quadrant labels print on a 7% wash of their own colour over the page ground rather than on a solid fill, so the fill's ink chooser does not reach them. The first version inherited the quadrant colour as the label ink and **all four failed AA in dark, two in light** — on a page whose subject is checking both themes. They now take theme-aware inks from `css/fundamentals.css`, checked against both grounds.
- A consistency check while writing the data caught two cases whose coordinates contradicted the quadrant they were labelled with. Maternity leave was scored for the relief the Act promises rather than the share of women it reaches; corrected downward, which moves it to the quadrant the page's own reading describes.

## [10.214.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **An invisible overlay was swallowing every tap on mobile.** `blog.html`, `about.html` and `404.html` each declared the mobile menu backdrop as `display: none; opacity: 0; position: fixed; inset 100%`, and then turned it on unconditionally inside the mobile media query:

  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) { .mobile-menu-overlay { display: block; } }
  ```

  An `opacity: 0` element is still hit-tested. So on any phone a full-viewport `div` wired to `closeMobileMenu()` sat over the page, and **no blog post could be opened** — the doorway to every post on the site. Nothing rendered wrong, nothing errored, and both accessibility audits passed, because they read the desktop DOM and never tap anything. The overlay is now `pointer-events: none` at rest and `auto` when open, on all 17 pages that carry one.

- **1,916 colour pairs failed WCAG AA in one theme or both.** A colour is only ever half-chosen: a value picked against the light surfaces can be unreadable on the dark ones. Corrected in the shared stylesheets (57 rules) and in inline page CSS (1,859 rules across 615 pages), each replacement preserving the original hue and moving only its lightness until it clears 4.5:1 — 3:1 where the rule declares large text. Where a pair resolves differently per theme, one literal cannot serve both (a near-white ground needs a dark ink, a near-slate ground a light one), so those 357 rules carry the light value and a theme-scoped override covering the unstamped default and both explicit choices.

  Representative cases:

  - `.card-number` was fixed once already, to `#075985`, with a comment recording the **6.90:1** it achieved on the light hover surface. On the dark one the same ink is **1.37:1**.
  - The eight language chips on `testimonials.html` paint a hue at 12% over the card and print the same hue on top. Seven of the eight failed — 2.45:1 to 3.25:1 in light, 2.37:1 to 4.38:1 in dark.
  - White button labels on the brand sky `#0EA5E9` are **2.77:1**; on the success green `#10B981`, **2.54:1**; on WhatsApp green `#25D366`, **1.98:1**.
  - `--accent-color` used as text on `--hover-bg` is **2.53:1** in light. Three of the four rules doing this are `:hover` states, which axe-core does not evaluate at all.

  `--accent-color` keeps its role as the brand hue for fills, borders and icons; `--accent-solid` is for a surface carrying white text and `--accent-ink` for accent-coloured text. `product.css` gets the same split.

- **`--text-color` was referenced ten times in `css/imx-main.css` and defined nowhere**, so every one of those `color:` declarations was invalid at computed-value time and silently fell back to the inherited colour. Now defined in both themes.

- **`css/imx-main.min.css` was maintained by hand and had gone stale.** `index.html` loads the minified copy, so the contrast fixes landed in the source without reaching the busiest page on the site.

- **The Capability Approach diagram overflowed on narrow screens.** In the vertical layout the conversion-factor labels sat in a right-hand column that did not fit: `ENVIRONMENTAL` ran past the viewBox edge and the leak label landed on top of it. The labels are redundant there — the Conversion box's own text reads "Personal, social, environmental" — so the narrow layout drops the column and carries the colour coding as a legend along the foot, laid out by measuring each label rather than estimating from its character count. The leak gets its own line, and its curve no longer ticks upward at the tip.

- **The Fundamentals index said "Four so far" while listing five frameworks**, and its meta description named only two of them.

### Added — guards

Four CI jobs, each for a failure that leaves nothing on the page to see:

- `theme-contrast` — `scripts/check-theme-contrast.py` resolves every colour/background pair through its `var()` chain in both themes and fails below AA. Theme-scoped selectors are evaluated only in the theme they apply to, rules whose background a more specific companion replaces are skipped, and theme-scoped overrides are resolved before judging a base rule. Gated on the shared stylesheets, where it is deterministic and was checked against a browser; `--pages` reports on inline page CSS without gating it, because a page's several `<style>` elements, utility-class overrides and tints over an ancestor's gradient cannot be resolved reliably from source — a first attempt over pages reported 6,397 rules, essentially all correct on screen.
- `tap-traps` — `scripts/check-tap-traps.py` fails any element that covers the viewport, rests at `opacity: 0`, is displayed, and does not declare `pointer-events: none`. `visibility: hidden` and `display: none` are excluded, since both already remove an element from hit-testing.
- `min-css-fresh` — `scripts/build-min-css.py` regenerates `imx-main.min.css` and verifies, by parsing both files back to selector-and-declarations, that minifying changed nothing but whitespace. `--check` fails when the built file is stale.
- `fundamentals-index` — `scripts/check-fundamentals-index.py` checks the landing page's stated count against the cards it lists, that every card resolves, and that every shipped framework is linked.

### Note on the existing audits

Neither accessibility job would have caught any of this. axe-core does run both themes, but over ten pages, and it never evaluates `:hover` state contrast or a tap target's occlusion. pa11y runs the default theme at desktop width. Both reported zero violations on the run that shipped the mobile tap trap.

## [10.213.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Blog: *Animal Welfare Law and the Fifty-Rupee Fine*** — a long read on Indian animal welfare law, built out of the Deep Dive published earlier today. Four charts, every figure traced to a named source.

  The lead chart deflates the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act's maximum first-offence fine by the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (MoSPI, base 1986-87 = 100). The nominal figure has been ₹50 since 1960 and has never moved; in real terms it is **₹3.79** by December 2024. The chart is drawn on a true time axis rather than equal spacing between unequal intervals, and it says plainly that the Act predates the CPI baseline by 26 years so the real erosion is larger than it can show.

  Also: the 851.81 million birds of the 20th Livestock Census split into 534.74m commercial and 317.07m backyard, since only the commercial share is what the never-notified 2017 cage rules would reach; the cage-free share for the UK (82%) and EU (62%) against an empty row for India, because no official Indian figure exists and the often-quoted 70% caged is an advocacy estimate; and a diagram of the mechanism behind the finding that slaughter restrictions appear to have worsened welfare across the herd.

### Fixed — infrastructure

- **Four social preview images pointed at files that do not exist**, so those pages shared with no picture and nothing reported it. One was a blog post published the same morning. `scripts/check-social-images.py` now checks every `og:image` and `twitter:image` against the filesystem — 1,160 references across 860 pages — and is wired into CI as the `social-images` job. A first pass at the check flagged a URL-encoded filename as missing, so it decodes before testing.

## [10.212.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **The Capability Approach page now has an actual diagram.** The conversion chain was four styled boxes — a layout, not a picture, and the weakest visual in a series where every other page has a drawn one. It is now an SVG that shows the mechanism: the three conversion factors feed the second stage as inputs rather than sitting beside it as decoration, and what fails to convert leaves the chain on a visible leak. Where a resource has a real pair of figures the leak carries them — `98.1% → 44.8%` for a school place, `100% → 19%` for a toilet — and where it does not, it says "what does not convert" rather than printing a headline that is not a quantity. Two layouts, chosen by container width, because four boxes across a phone shrinks the type past reading.

- **Two material resources added to the Capability Approach: a household water connection and an internet connection**, both grounded in MoSPI survey data pulled from the source rather than recalled. They came out of Pallavi's suggestion that the Fundamentals need a parameter on infrastructure. They are on the capability page rather than as new spokes on the wheel because that is where they actually belong: infrastructure is Sen's environmental conversion factor, which the chain already has a stage for, and the wheel's twelve axes are about who a person is rather than where they are.

  Water: 94.5% of rural households have access to an improved source; 56.1% have it within the premises; **42.0%** have it exclusively, in the premises, and sufficiently all year (NSS 76th Round). Three figures, same households, same survey, each adding one condition.

  Internet: 83.3% of rural households have an internet facility within the premises, and **9.1%** of those have a fixed or WiFi connection rather than only a mobile one (NSS 80th Round, 2025). Government services move online against the first number.

- **Every CI job now has a `timeout-minutes`.** All 22 had none, so each inherited GitHub's 360-minute default. This was not hypothetical: the mobile-overflow audit hung for over twenty minutes inside its Playwright install on PR #949 without reaching the test body, and a hung job neither passes nor fails — it reads as "still running". On the scheduled run, where `broken-links` is `fail: true`, link rot could go unreported for six hours and nobody would be told. Fast static guards get 10 minutes, browser jobs 20, network-bound 15.

## [10.211.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **The Wheel of Power can now derive your position from twelve questions** instead of asking you to mark it. Self-placement measures self-perception, and self-perception is patterned by power in the direction that matters most: people near the centre routinely place themselves further out, so the error was never random. The questions ask about categories as a matter of fact, then apply the wheel's own published band definitions and show the definition beside each placement, so the reasoning is visible and can be argued with. Every question can be skipped, and skipping is offered as an answer rather than an escape. Suggested by Pallavi.

  Answers are written to the same `localStorage` key the manual marks already used, so a derived position and a hand-marked one are the same thing to the wheel and neither route loses the other's work.

### Added — infrastructure

- `scripts/check-fundamentals-privacy.py`, wired into CI as the `fundamentals-privacy` job. The page tells the reader their answers stay in their browser and are sent nowhere; that is a promise about code, so it is now enforced by code. The guard fails if the questionnaire files gain any network primitive — fetch, XHR, sendBeacon, WebSocket, EventSource, dynamic import, form submit, gtag or dataLayer — and also fails if the promise is quietly removed from the page, so it cannot be satisfied by deleting the sentence. Verified against both failure modes.

## [10.210.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Form submissions could be lost without anyone knowing** (#947, #948). Three faults compounded. `fetch()` resolves on 404 and 500, and all 69 Netlify POST handlers were written as `.then(showSuccess).catch(showError)`, so only a dropped connection ever showed an error — a *rejected* submission showed "received". `challenge_submissions` had held 0 rows since creation, because `syncSubmission()` returned early for signed-out users and `user_id` was `NOT NULL` with no email column. And Netlify Forms accepts a submission its spam filter discards with HTTP 200, so `response.ok` cannot detect that one was dropped.

  The third fault is the one that cost something real: six genuine event registrations were classified as spam and never delivered — two people each signing up for three sessions inside a minute, where the burst rate alone was enough to trip the filter. (The three challenge submissions the filter caught were, on inspection, crypto-phishing bots; that call was correct.)

  Every handler now checks `response.ok`. `public.form_submissions` stores an allowlisted copy of every consequential form, written only by `netlify/functions/form-submit.mjs` with the service role — RLS on, no policies, no grants, so anon can neither read nor write it. `js/form-submit.js` sends to both paths and succeeds if either lands. `events.html` needed rewriting rather than patching: it was `.then(done).catch(done)`, confirming success on failure by design.

  Deliberately left on Netlify Forms alone: `chatbot-feedback` and `podcast-newsletter`, where a lost submission costs nothing.

### Added

- **Attachments on Live Case Challenges.** PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint or an image, up to 8 MB. The form previously had no file input, and adding one alone would not have worked — the handler built its body with `URLSearchParams(FormData)`, which silently discards `File` objects.
- **Email is now required** when submitting a challenge, since it is the only way feedback can be returned. The blank submission template can no longer be submitted unchanged; it is prefilled as the textarea's value, so it cleared the 200-character minimum on its own.
- Three contract tests (`test-form-submit`, `test-challenge-submit`, `test-form-submit-endpoint`) wired into `ci.yml` as the `form-submission` job, so the false-success bug cannot return unnoticed.

## [10.210.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Fundamentals: The Capability Approach** — the fifth page in the series. Sen's distinction between a resource, a capability and a functioning, drawn as a four-stage conversion chain, with five Indian resources followed from end to end: a school place, a household toilet, a bicycle, household income and a ration entitlement. Fifteen evidence entries, each with a named source and year. Includes Nussbaum's ten central capabilities and the reason Sen declined to write such a list.

  The page opens on the pair that makes the argument: 98.1% of rural children aged 6–14 were enrolled in 2024, and 44.8% of Std V children in government schools could read a Std II text. Both are ASER 2024, taken from the report rather than from memory — the second is the government-school figure specifically, which is the kind of detail that goes wrong when statistics are asserted rather than checked.

  `scripts/check-diagram-contrast.py` now covers the new renderer, making it five. Verified by reintroducing the luminance-cutoff bug and confirming the guard fails.

## [10.209.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Reading companion: *The Science and Application of Positive Psychology*** (Cheavens & Feldman, Cambridge). Eight sections and thirteen concepts. The book's case for studying the positive rests on an asymmetry rather than on optimism: Brickman's 1978 lottery-winner study found no durable happiness gain a year on while accident survivors' negative feelings persisted, and Baumeister's 2001 review found the same asymmetry across finances, friendships and intimate relationships. The chapter most useful outside a classroom is the research-literacy one — whether a mechanism is specified, whether correlation is being sold as causation, whether the sample supports the generalisation — which the authors wrote to separate the field from the pop psychology that borrows its vocabulary. The companion also carries the book's own note that Western psychology has studied wellbeing hedonically while eudaimonic accounts predominate in Eastern traditions.

- **Reading companion: *Unlimited Memory*** (Kevin Horsley). Four sections and twelve concepts covering the SEE principle, the journey and body-peg methods, the number and name systems, and the spaced-review chapter without which the methods decay. This one is a popular technique manual rather than a research volume, and the companion says so: it records where Horsley's claims line up with the cognitive-science literature on encoding and spacing, and where they are presented as method rather than as evidence.

  Reading companions now 166.

## [10.208.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Reading companion: *Public Health, Ethics, and Equity*** (Anand, Peter & Sen, Oxford 2004). Nine sections and fourteen concepts covering Sen's argument that health equity cannot be assessed by looking at health alone, Marmot's social gradient and his rejection of health selection, the Rawlsian and indirect accounts of when an inequality is unjust, Anand and Hanson's critique of DALY age-weighting and discounting, and Sen's external-versus-internal perspectives — including the Kerala case, where the state with India's highest life expectancy also reports its highest self-perceived morbidity. Reading companions now 164.

  Two honest limits are recorded in the companion itself: the volume predates the 2010 GBD revision that dropped age-weighting, so some of Anand and Hanson's specific numerical objections describe an earlier version of the metric; and the gradient evidence comes from salaried British civil servants, so its transfer to informal labour markets is an open question.

## [10.207.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Blog: "The p-value answers a question you probably aren't asking."** On the difference between what a p-value and a confidence interval each tell you, with a worked example where the same point estimate and the same p = 0.03 support opposite programme decisions depending on the interval. Cites the ASA statement (2016), Greenland et al.'s twenty-five misinterpretations (2016), and Amrhein et al. in *Nature* (2019). The diagram is inline SVG rather than a raster illustration, so it carries real text, follows the theme, and scales without a second asset.

### Fixed

- **`.checklist-item` is `display:flex` with no `flex-wrap`**, so any item whose content starts with an element rather than bare text splits into several flex items that cannot wrap. Existing posts use plain text and were unaffected; wrapping the content in a single span is enough.
- Three more contrast failures on the blog template, all found by auditing in dark mode: the category chip (white on `#6366F1`, 4.47:1 — under AA by 0.03), `.article-tag` (4.04:1), and links inside `.checklist` which the blog's link styling never reached and which fell back to the browser default blue at 1.56:1 on the dark card.
- `.article-tag` and `.chip-count` fail for the same reason: `--text-muted` on `--hover-bg` is **4.04:1 in dark mode**. That pairing is used elsewhere and is worth a sweep rather than another one-off fix.

## [10.206.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Deep Dive: Farm Animal Welfare in India** — 14 readings across five sections, on the gap between what Indian animal welfare law says and what it costs to break. Covers the 20th Livestock Census headcounts, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 and its unrevised fifty-rupee first-offence fine, *AWBI v. A. Nagaraja* (2014) reading animal dignity into Article 21, the Law Commission's 269th Report which drafted cage-free rules that were never notified, and the peer-reviewed evidence that slaughter restrictions worsen dairy herd welfare. Deep Dives now 23.

### Fixed

- **Every Deep Dive had contrast failures in both themes.** The six `.dd-type` badges used one hue as both the 12% background wash and the text, putting them at 2.1–3.9:1 in light mode; inks darkened, tints unchanged. `--dd-accent` was 2.62:1 as eyebrow and section-number ink on the cream page background; it is now 5.2–5.6:1 in every place it is used as ink. The same token doubles as the CTA button background, where white sat on light amber at 2.15:1 in dark mode, so the button now takes the opposite ink. One stylesheet, 23 pages.
- **Two more dark-mode contrast failures found by the new axe variants**: `.chip-count` on `bct-repository.html` (4.04:1 — `--text-muted` on `--hover-bg`, a token pairing that fails anywhere it is used in dark mode) and the earlier `.ims-nav-btn`, `social_proof.trusted_by` and `.practitioner-trust-strip` issues on `index.html`.

## [10.205.0] - 2026-08-19

### Security

- **Closed the RPC surface on Supabase.** `notify_user` was executable by the unauthenticated `anon` role over `/rest/v1/rpc/`, taking an arbitrary `p_user_id` plus free-text `p_title`, `p_body` and `p_link` — a route to address notification content at any user without signing in. `update_streak` was anon-executable with an arbitrary `p_user_id`. Seven trigger functions carried the same grant. The cause in every case was Postgres's default `EXECUTE` grant to `PUBLIC`, which nothing had revoked; a first migration that revoked from `anon`/`authenticated` changed nothing, because neither role held an explicit grant. Every revoke was checked against a caller first: `notify_user` is only used by the `send-notification` edge function through a service-role client, and `update_streak` by `js/auth.js` for the signed-in user's own id, so both keep working. `get_public_stats` is deliberately untouched — `transparency.html` and `js/live-stats.js` read it unauthenticated. `search_path` is now pinned on all nine `SECURITY DEFINER` functions.
- **`scripts/check-supabase-anon.py` now probes RPCs, not just tables.** All seven of its previous probes were table reads, which is why the exposure above had never appeared in CI. Seven RPC probes were added, sending a no-argument body so a function that takes arguments cannot run — this checks visibility, never behaviour.

### Fixed

- **The wheel's label auto-shrink had never worked.** `fitLabels()` set `font-size` as a presentation attribute, and the `.seg-label.r-*` rules in the stylesheet outrank it, so the computed size never changed. Eight of twelve outer-ring labels overran their arc, the worst by 21%, and read as touching the wedge dividers. Now set as an inline style, with the fill target dropped from 92% to 84% of the arc: every outer label clears its dividers by 11px or more.
- **Four stale numbers on `libraries.html`** — Reading Companions 149→163, Handouts 89→90, Dataverse 321→328, and a hero chip reading "9 libraries" against 16 cards. The Fundamentals card still described only the wheel; it now describes all four maps.
- **`scripts/check-counts.py` missed label-then-number tiles.** Its only label-first rule was hardcoded to the homepage's `tp-cnt` class, so `libraries.html`'s `<span class="lib-n">…</span><span class="lib-c">149</span>` drifted unnoticed. Matching is now on shape, not class name. `data-explorers` is also enforced now — the one key of fifteen that was not, and the one that had drifted before.

### Changed

- **Asset-hash stamping widened from 5 pages to 197.** The stale-pairing risk the stamping fixes is not specific to Fundamentals: the service worker serves HTML network-first and assets stale-while-revalidate site-wide.
- **The axe audit now runs four variants per page** — light and dark theme, desktop and mobile width. Running only the default light theme at desktop is how a dark-mode-only contrast failure shipped.
- `sitemap.html` is excluded from the count tile rules; its `<span class="cnt">` tallies count the links in each section, and every one was verified to match. That check did surface a real gap: the sitemap lists 17 of 19 flagship courses, 31 of 35 labs and 21 of 22 deep dives.

## [10.204.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Fundamentals pages could render blank after a deploy** (reported on a phone: the Power Cube an empty box, the Who Counts matrix absent, both captions empty). Nothing was broken in the code and nothing was red in CI. `service-worker.js` serves HTML network-first and static assets stale-while-revalidate — deliberate, and correct for offline — so the first load after a deploy could pair fresh HTML with the previous deploy's JS: markup declaring `<svg id="cubeSvg">` next to cached JS with no code to draw into it. Every `/css/*` and `/js/*` reference on the five Fundamentals pages now carries `?v=<content hash>` (`scripts/stamp-assets.py`), so a URL changes whenever its file does and fresh HTML can never request an asset that is already cached. The service worker `VERSION` was bumped to purge the stale runtime caches. Reproduced first by serving the new HTML against the previous commit's assets, which showed the exact symptom.
- **Every label on the outer ring of the Wheel failed WCAG AA** (2.32–3.21:1, desktop, default theme). `readableOn()` chose its ink from a fixed luminance cutoff of 0.42; the rim fills are each axis colour mixed 42% with white and land just under it, so all twelve took white text. They now take dark ink (5.26–7.27:1). The same defect had already been fixed in the cube, ladder and matrix renderers by comparing the two candidate inks instead of guessing a cutoff — the wheel never got that change.
- **The Power Cube's three face titles were unreadable in dark mode** (SPACES 2.76:1, LEVELS 2.87:1, FORMS 3.13:1). They were drawn in each dimension's own colour, which is mixed for the cream panel, not the dark one. They are now set in CSS with a colour per theme (6.7–7.2:1 light, 8.5–10.6:1 dark).

### Added

- **`scripts/check-diagram-contrast.py`**, run in CI as `diagram-contrast`. Checks that every colour the four diagrams paint text on — including the wheel's three ring mixes — has an ink clearing 4.5:1, *and* that each renderer picks that ink by comparing contrast ratios rather than testing luminance against a constant. The second check is the one that matters: the first passes even when the code picks the worse of the two inks, which is what shipped twice. Neither existing audit covers this — axe-core does not evaluate SVG text contrast, and both axe and pa11y run only the light theme at desktop width.
- **`scripts/stamp-assets.py`**, run in CI as `asset-stamps`, which fails if any page's asset stamps are stale.
- `fundamentals/index.html` was missing from `.pa11yci`; it is now audited with the other four.

## [10.203.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Fundamentals is now reachable from every page** (#937). It shipped linked from only two places, neither of them navigation: one card 41% down the homepage (17th of 18 in a horizontal scroll strip) and `sitemap.html`. It now sits in the "Explore" column of the footer that `js/site-chrome.js` injects sitewide, and in `libraries.html` under Learn & Practice.
- **`libraries.html` was stale for more than that page**, so the same pass added the two other collections it was missing: **The Long View** under Data & Research and **Marginalia** under Read & Reference. Skills Profiler was deliberately left out — the page's lede scopes it to "the reference collections you browse, look things up in, and read", and the profiler is a single assessment tool rather than a collection. New cards carry no count badge, matching ImpactLex, DevDiscourses, PolicyDhara and FieldCases, none of which has a canonical figure in `data/counts.json`.
- **Prose pass on the Fundamentals page** (#936, #935). The copy read as machine-generated and was rewritten: 99 em-dashes in the data file cut to 23, the "X is not Y, it is Z" opener dropped from most axes, the epigram closing nearly every paragraph replaced with a fact, a literal "It is not a score / It is not additive / It is not fixed" triad broken up, and self-congratulatory asides ("an honest note", "the disagreements are the point") removed. 36 editorial strings, 55 evidence captions, the hero, method and credits sections, and the renderer's own copy. No figure, source, year or placement changed — the 113 evidence entries were re-counted across all 36 bands afterwards.

### Fixed

- **JSON-LD drift in `libraries.html`**: the `CollectionPage` structured data declared `numberOfItems: 12` against 13 listed items. Now 16 against 16.
- **Heading-order jump in the Fundamentals text index**: it went from the section `h2` straight to `h5`, because axis names sat in `<summary>` as plain text. Axis names are now `h3` and ring titles `h4`.

### Known issues

- `libraries.html` carries two pre-existing WCAG AA failures, identical on untouched `main`: `--acc` `#0EA5E9` on `--bg` `#F5F7FA` at **2.58:1**, and `--faint` `#6B7A93` at **4.05:1**, both needing 4.5:1. Dark mode's `--faint` is marginal at 4.41:1. Not fixed because `--acc` also paints two backgrounds and a border, so a correct fix needs a separate `--acc-ink` token rather than darkening `--acc` globally. Worked values: `--acc-ink: #0369A1` (5.53:1), light `--faint: #626F82` (4.75:1), dark `--faint: #717F98` (4.74:1).
- This is the third page-level instance of the same class of defect, after the site-wide `--color-text-muted` `#718096` (4.01:1 on white) and `#667eea` link colour (3.66:1) found during #935. The pattern is the brand palette, not any individual page, and is worth fixing at the token level.
- `Mobile overflow audit (390px)` and `Check broken links` both stalled `in_progress` rather than failing on #935 and #936, with logs returning 404 — they die before running any test body. Both completed normally on #937 (2:58 and 3:45), so the stalls are transient runner failures. A check that hangs instead of failing is one nobody can rely on.

## [10.202.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`fundamentals.html` — the Indian Wheel of Power & Powerlessness as a clickable map.** A 12-axis / 3-ring SVG wheel (36 segments) rendered from `js/fundamentals-data.js`, with a detail panel per segment carrying sourced Indian evidence, an axis-level "what this does not settle" note, and cross-links into the relevant explorers and labs. Styling in `css/fundamentals.css`; interaction in `js/fundamentals-wheel.js`.
- **The evidence layer: 113 entries across the 36 bands**, each with a named source and year. Every figure is traceable to a national statistical source (Census, NFHS-5, PLFS, NSS 76th Round, NCRB, AISHE, ASER, Time Use Survey), a statute or constitutional provision, or a reported judgment; nothing unsourced was admitted. Two MPI figures are labelled as coming from the NITI Aayog National MPI *baseline* round (NFHS-4, 2015–16), which is where the social-group breakdown is published — the 2023 Progress Review does not restate it.
- **Attribution is a first-class section, not a footnote.** The wheel is credited to The Listeners Collective (Disha Paul, Ayush Biswas, Trupti M., Ganga Nair; developed 2022, published 2023), the wheel it adapts to Sylvia Duckworth for the Canadian Council for Refugees, the underlying argument to Crenshaw and Collins, and the Indian lineage to Ambedkar, the Phules, Chakravarti, Rege and Guru.
- **Accessibility and sharing.** Every segment is a keyboard-reachable button (arrow keys move between axes and bands, Enter opens, Escape clears); each selection gets its own `#axis/ring` deep link that scrolls to the wheel on load; and the full dataset is duplicated as a plain-text `<details>` index that reads without the SVG and prints cleanly.
- **An optional "mark where you sit" mode**, persisted to `localStorage` only. It deliberately produces no score and no total — the page says why in "What this wheel is not".

### Fixed

- `sitemap.html` — the "Explore & Community" group count was stating 23 for 22 links; corrected to the actual count.

### Notes

- The hero is a `<section>` inside `<main>` rather than a top-level `<header>`, because `js/site-chrome.js` removes every `<header>`/`<nav>` that is a direct child of `<body>` when it injects the standard chrome. The same applies to the skip link, which is now a bare `<a>`.
- The page palette mirrors its dark tokens behind `prefers-color-scheme` as well as `[data-theme="dark"]`, because `site-chrome.js` removes `data-theme` entirely in "system" mode.

## [10.201.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **unspurious joins The Greats.** A new card in the Long View gallery (`the-long-view/gallery.html`) links out to [unspurious.com](https://unspurious.com/), a compendium of twenty-eight statistical illusions — Simpson's and Berkson's paradoxes, the base-rate fallacy, Anscombe's quartet — each built from numbers that are individually true and still lead a careful reader to the wrong conclusion. It is the natural companion to the gallery's existing "How to read a chart honestly" card and to `the-long-view/numbers-in-the-news.html`, and its "Lie With This Chart" tool is the hands-on version of our own note on truncated axes.
- **New gallery filter: "How Numbers Mislead."** The Greats' filter chips were all subject areas (Poverty, Gender, Climate…), with nowhere to put work about *method*. This adds an eleventh chip for it. It holds one card today.

## [10.200.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **Branch review complete.** The 8 branches left after the 46-branch sweep were audited individually. Five had no remaining value and are queued for deletion in `.github/stale-branches.txt`: two were **0 commits ahead of `main`**, one held images already on `main`, one was superseded (main carries 33 page dictionaries per language against its 30, plus a Telugu set it lacked entirely), and one's mobile fixes had landed via #417 — confirmed by loading three flagship courses at 390px and finding zero overflow and zero malformed quiz options. Two held real unpublished work and were rescued (#926, #927). The last — a homepage "Free Tools" / freemium reframing — was **retired by owner decision**: it would have made most of the 14 `premium-tools/` pages free (only one is free today), a pricing call rather than a tidy-up. It was also unmergeable on its own terms — forked 2026-06-24 and last touched 2026-07-01, it trails `main` by 323 commits, which have since changed 94 of the 97 files it edits, so a test merge yields 47 conflicts. Queued for deletion (list now 52); if the freemium direction is revived it should be built fresh against `main`.

## [10.197.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **The last 13 dead citations resolved** (#925) — 11 repointed to verified targets, 2 unlinked. Again the research showed several were not moved pages but *mislinked works*: J-PAL's `/handbook` and `/page/poor-economics` were pointing at J-PAL for books published by **Princeton UP** (*Running Randomized Evaluations*, Glennerster & Takavarasha) and **PublicAffairs** (*Poor Economics*, Banerjee & Duflo); the Blavatnik School link for Andrews/Pritchett/Woolcock's PDIA work now points at **Building State Capability** at Harvard, where that work lives; and the `aeaweb` link for Dean Spears' child-height paper pointed at a nonexistent AEJ article when the work is **World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6351** (2013). WHO's life-skills guidance moved to **IRIS** (`10665/63552`), and the WID "billionaire raj" link now resolves to the actual Bharti/Chancel/Piketty/Somanchi working paper — the same one The Long View already cites.
- **Two unlinked rather than guessed**: J-PAL's *The Stopgap* podcast and a Brookings SEL policy report (Care et al.) have no findable current equivalent. Citation text kept in full, dead `href` removed — a reader loses nothing but a broken click.
- **The site's LinkedIn URL was wrong on 35 pages.** `linkedin.com/company/impactmojo` is a genuine 404; the real page is **`linkedin.com/company/learn-impactmojo/`**. Confirmed with a browser user-agent — the new handle returns 200, the old one 404 — so this was real breakage, not the bot-blocking false positive it first looked like. Fixed everywhere it appeared (footers, legal pages, press kit, sitemap, JSON-LD `sameAs`), not just the one page the audit happened to flag.
- With this, **every dead external link found in the DeepDives audit is resolved**: 30 confirmed 404s → 5 fixed in #922, 11 in #924, 14 here.

## [10.196.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Eleven more dead citations, each researched to the actual work** (#924). The earlier pass (#922) fixed only the five whose new home was unambiguous and left the rest, on the grounds that a wrong publisher or DOI is a mis-citation and worse than a 404. Researching them properly resolved eleven, and turned up that several were not *moved* links but *wrong* ones:
  - **Cartwright & Hardie, *Evidence-Based Policy*** was linked to Cambridge; the book is **Oxford University Press** (the page's own citation already said "Oxford, 2012"). → `academic.oup.com/book/11611`
  - **Jaffrelot, *Modi's India*** was linked to Harvard UP; it is **Princeton**. → `press.princeton.edu/.../modis-india`
  - **Teltumbde, *Republic of Caste*** was linked to Penguin India; it is **Navayana**. → `navayana.org/products/republic-of-caste/`
  - **The journal *Public Choice*** was linked to Cambridge Core; it is **Springer**. → `link.springer.com/journal/11127`
  - **Biran et al., SuperAmma handwashing trial** carried DOI `S2214-109X(14)70160-8`; the correct DOI is **`(13)70160-8`** (Lancet Glob Health 2014;2(3):e145–54 — Elsevier registered it in 2013).
  - **Jones & Bouffard, "SEL in Schools: From Programs to Strategies"** carried an *Educational Psychologist* DOI; the article is SRCD's **Social Policy Report** 26(4), 2012. → `10.1002/j.2379-3988.2012.tb00073.x`
  - Plus corrected editions/paths for Cohn's *Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge* (Princeton ISBN), Kohli's *Poverty Amid Plenty*, Ambedkar's *Annihilation of Caste*, the Social Security Code 2020, and a World Bank working paper.
  
  Nine of the eleven return 200; the OUP and Wiley targets return 403 to automated requests but were confirmed to exist. **Fourteen dead links remain** and are still listed in #922 — they need someone who knows which specific resource was meant.

## [10.195.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **`Delete stale branches` workflow** (`.github/workflows/delete-stale-branches.yml`) — manual cleanup of the 46 branches left behind by the retired maintenance Routines, with the list held in `.github/stale-branches.txt` so it is reviewable in version control rather than buried in a script. A workflow is used because branch deletion is impossible from a Claude Code session (the agent proxy blocks repo-scoped GitHub writes, and the `$GITHUB_PAT` fallback hits the same wall) and a pull request cannot delete other branches; a workflow runs on GitHub with its own token. Safety: `workflow_dispatch` only, dry-run unless the operator types `DELETE`, and it refuses the default branch, protected branches, and — re-checked live at run time, not from the audit — any branch with an open pull request. Every run writes a summary table of what was deleted, skipped and why.

## [10.194.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **Data-currency notices on four explorers** (#921): `nas.html`, `nfhs.html`, `plfs.html` and `udise.html` now say plainly that their survey round has been superseded, and `dataverse-india.html` records Census 2027 and NFHS-6 as current. Drafted by the never-merged `fact-check-20260801` routine but **verified against primary sources before publishing** — PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024 (run 4 Dec 2024, results from July 2025, Classes 3/6/9 rather than 3/5/8/10), NFHS-6 (fielded 2023-24, released 29 May 2026), the PLFS Annual Report for CY2025 (March 2026, redesigned ~2.7 lakh sample, July–June → Jan–Dec cycle break), UDISE+ 2025-26 (7 July 2026), and Census 2027 (digital, self-enumeration, caste enumerated for the first time since 1931). The routine's draft had Census 2027 population enumeration in "Mar 2027"; it is **February 2027**, corrected. The "this page still shows X" half of each notice was checked against the pages themselves. Wording says the explorer has not been rebuilt yet rather than implying the figures shown are wrong — they remain accurate for the round they describe.

### Fixed

- **Five dead citation links** (#922): Building State Capability → `bsc.hks.harvard.edu` (moved to Harvard Kennedy School), the PRS bill-tracker entry for the Rajasthan gig-workers bill → the enacted Act 29 of 2023 PDF, two J-PAL deep links → `povertyactionlab.org/research-resources` (where that material was consolidated), and the MHRD-era NEP PDF path → `education.gov.in/nep/nep-2020`. Each replacement confirmed to return 200 before committing. Found by scanning every external link in the 40 files the `external-links` routines touched: **30 confirmed 404s, plus 30 × 403 that are publisher bot-blocking rather than breakage** and were deliberately left alone. The remaining 25 dead links are documented in #922 rather than guessed — they are mostly publisher/book pages and three DOIs, where picking the wrong edition or record would turn a dead link into a mis-citation.

## [10.193.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Three Netlify forms had spam protection that did nothing** (#920): `challenges.html` (`challenge-submission`), `index.html` (`chatbot-feedback`) and `podcast.html` (`podcast-newsletter`) each set `netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` but carried no matching input in the form. Netlify requires both — the attribute names the field, the field has to exist — so the honeypot on those three was inert. Found by the retired `forms-health` routine on 2026-07-31 and never merged; re-audited against main before fixing, which confirmed exactly those 3 broken against 77 correct forms. Fixed with the `<p style="display:none">` pattern the other 77 already use; the routine's own version added a bare visible `<input>` on two of the three.

### Added

- **Structured data on 25 pages** (#920): `Dataset` JSON-LD on the data explorers (`aishe`, `aser`, `eci`, `energy`, `ihds`, `migration`, `nas`, `plfs`, `scheme-tracker`, `udise`, `explorers`) and `LearningResource` JSON-LD on 14 BookSummaries companions, plus `og:image` on the 10 explorer pages that had none. Recovered from the unmerged `seo-health-20260801` and `content-wiring-20260729` routine branches and re-derived onto current main. Both branches had independently written a JSON-LD block for the same 14 companions, so applying both produced two competing `LearningResource` blocks per page; deduplicated by keeping whichever `name` matches the page's own `<title>`. Their `sitemap.xml` rewrite was deliberately not taken — main's sitemap has moved on and theirs would have reverted newer entries.

## [10.192.0] - 2026-08-15

### Security

- **All 14 npm advisories cleared** (#918) — root 9 high → 0, `mcp-server/` 2 high + 2 moderate + 1 low → 0. Non-breaking lockfile fixes for axios 1.19.0, js-yaml 4.3.1, ip-address 10.5.0 and the chromedriver/extract-zip chain under `@axe-core/cli`; hono, `@hono/node-server`, fast-uri and body-parser in `mcp-server/`. The last four root advisories all traced to one root cause, so **puppeteer 24.43.1 → 25.7.0**, a semver-major that required a code change: v23 dropped the `headless: 'new'` string (v25 types are `boolean | 'shell'`), so `tests/axe-accessibility.js` now passes `headless: true`. Left unchanged, the bump would have broken the a11y gate. Scope note: every one of these is a CI devDependency or the internal MCP server — root `dependencies` is empty and the public site ships no npm runtime code, so none was reachable from impactmojo.in.
- **New `supabase-anon` guard** (#919) — `scripts/check-supabase-anon.py` re-probes the anon access contract established by the 2026-08-03 remediation (#895): the four remediated tables and the sensitive `profiles` columns must stay anon-denied (401), while `certificates` and the granted `profiles` columns must stay readable (200), so an over-correction that breaks certificate verification fails the guard as loudly as a leak would. Needs **no secrets** — the URL and anon key are read from `js/config.js`, the same pair every browser receives. Runs on the daily schedule and `workflow_dispatch` only, since it hits live PostgREST.

### Fixed

- **Link rot could never turn CI red** (#919) — the `broken-links` job was `fail: false` unconditionally, so lychee's findings changed nothing. Link rot is precisely the failure that needs no commit, making the daily schedule the one place it mattered and the one place it was silent. Now `fail: ${{ github.event_name == 'schedule' }}`: pull requests stay unblocked by third-party flakiness, the scheduled run notifies the owner.
- **The a11y gate reported green on an unreachable site** (#919) — `tests/axe-accessibility.js` exited 0 when every page was SKIPPED, so zero violations across zero pages read as PASSED. It now fails when nothing was audited and prints `Pages audited : N of M`. Verified in both directions: exit 1 with no server reachable, exit 0 with pages audited.

### Changed

- **The ~12 scheduled maintenance Routines are retired**; their useful parts now live in `ci.yml` (#919). `list_triggers` confirms none of the ImpactMojo Routines created 2026-07-19 still exist — which is why nothing has pushed since 2026-08-04. They left 41 `claude/routine-<name>-<date>` branches, every one verified to have **zero PRs**: each run pushed a branch and never proposed it, so the work never reached `main`. The supabase-health routine recorded the symptom in its own snapshot file for eleven days. Counts, i18n, encoding, internal links and book companions were already enforced in `ci.yml` on every push and daily, so only the two gaps above needed new jobs. `.claude/rules/testing.md` and `.claude/memory.md` record why Routines should not be recreated as branch-pushers: anything that can drift without a commit belongs on `ci.yml`'s `schedule:`, where a red run notifies someone.

## [10.191.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Four new chart forms in The Long View** (`js/longview-charts.js`, `the-long-view.html`), taking the Data Wing from 31 to 35 charts. All hand-coded SVG in the existing engine — no charting library, theme-aware (redraw on `data-theme` mutation), `prefers-reduced-motion` aware.
  - `sankeyHub()` → **`c-rupee`**, the Union Budget 2025–26 drawn through a single hub node: 8 receipts narrow into ₹1, 9 spending heads fan out, ribbon thickness in paise so both sides balance at 100. Source: "Budget at a Glance".
  - `dotDensity()` → **`c-poor-dots`**, a dot-density tile map of multidimensional poverty, one dot per 10 lakh poor people, rejection-sampled inside each state's hexagon. Placement uses a mulberry32 PRNG seeded from the state code (`rng()`/`seedOf()`), so the scatter is identical on every redraw — `Math.random()` would have reshuffled the dots on each theme switch. 206 dots ≈ 20.6 crore, against NITI Aayog's ~20.9 crore national figure.
  - `dorling()` → **`c-seats`**, a Dorling cartogram of population per Lok Sabha seat: circles sized by Census 2011 population, coloured on a 16.7–27.4 lakh ramp, relaxed apart from hand-placed geographic anchors over 260 iterations with anchor springs and viewport clamping. Anchors are normalised to the data extents so the layout fills the frame.
  - `tilegram()` → **`c-tilegram`**, a 121-hexagon tilegram of India (1 hex = 1 crore, Census 2011). State outlines are derived from hex adjacency — an edge is stroked only where the neighbour across it belongs to a different state — rather than hand-drawn; group labels snap to the tile nearest each state's centroid, since the raw centroid often falls in the gutter between hexes. Hex size is fitted to the frame from the grid's col/row span.
  - Shared helpers extracted for the map forms: `rng()`, `seedOf()`, `hexAt()`, `hexPts()`, `inHex()`, `lerpCol()`.
- Wired into `ORDER` and `DETAILS` (so `/the-long-view/chart.html?c=…` and its prev/next navigation work), the page's "Where the numbers come from" list, `data/search-index.json` (new tags: sankey, alluvial, cartogram, tilegram, dot density, hex map, union budget, lok sabha, representation), `docs/long-view-guide.md` and `docs/changelog.md`.

### Notes

- The three new map forms are deliberately placed next to the existing hex cartogram (`c-states`): same country, four different decisions about what a map encodes — rate vs count vs magnitude vs units. The guide frames them as a sequence.
- Verified in Chromium at 1280px and 390px in both themes: all four charts fit their `viewBox`, all 206 dots assert inside their own hexagon, 42/42 page SVGs render non-empty, `ORDER`↔`DETAILS` are in bijection, no horizontal overflow, no JS errors. CI: 14 success + 1 neutral (Netlify informational).

## [10.162.0] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Challenge submissions had no reply path**: the `challenge-submission` Netlify form captured no contact field, so notification emails couldn't be answered. Added an optional email input to the submit section (`challenges.html` + `js/challenges.js`) — validated loosely, remembered in `localStorage` (`im-challenge-email`), pre-filled from the Supabase session for signed-in users, and sent as the `email` field so Netlify sets it as the notification's Reply-To. Site-wide form audit: all 19 other Netlify form types already collect email; the only remaining email-less form is the deliberately anonymous `chatbot-feedback` widget.

## [10.161.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **Law Guides — a new content category** (`/law-guides/`): six plain-English guides to Indian laws relevant to social-sector work, modelled on the practitioner-explainer format (role definitions, obligations, gray areas, collapsible FAQs, interactive compliance checklists persisted via `localStorage`). Covers FCRA 2010, CSR (Companies Act §135 + CSR Rules), POSH Act 2013, RTI Act 2005, child protection (POCSO 2012 + JJ Act 2015), and RPwD Act 2016, plus a hub page cross-linking the existing DPDP 101 course. Shared styling in `law-guides/lg-shared.css` (own visual identity, full brand chrome: topbar, theme toggle, footer, GA, auth scripts) and checklist logic in `law-guides/lg-shared.js`. Wired into search index (`LAW001`–`LAW007`, new `law-guide` type), sitemap, homepage Showcase strip, `data/counts.json` (`law-guides: 6`), and the counts guard (`law guides` term in `check-counts.py`).

## [10.144.0] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Livelihoods lexicon was unreachable from the course page**: `courses/livelihoods/lexicon.html` (53 terms) shipped in v10.136.0 alongside the Media and Power BI lexicons, but only those two got linked — the Livelihoods course sidebar, hero resource row, and its `courses/index.html` card never pointed to it. Added all three links; card-meta now shows "53 lexicon terms" like the other 17 flagships.

## [10.143.0] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Transparency page on mobile**: the Course Engagement chart's x-axis numbers no longer collide (fewer ticks + collision-avoidance on narrow screens, tighter left margin); the Feature Adoption table no longer overflows the card (dropped the always-"Active" Status column); the legacy "Platform Numbers" cards no longer label Dec-2025 figures with today's course/game/studio counts (now "across courses live in 2025 · Legacy estimate, to Dec 2025").

### Changed

- **Three developer blog posts rewritten for a general audience**: "Behind the Scenes: The Tools That Power ImpactMojo" → "Why ImpactMojo Works on Any Phone, on Any Connection"; the MCP-server post → "Now You Can Ask an AI Assistant to Search ImpactMojo"; the GitHub-ecosystem post → "How Open Tools Change What a Small NGO Can Do". Kept the ideas, translated the engineer-only detail; titles synced across JSON-LD, related-post cards, and the search index.
- **New maintenance routine**: monthly plain-language sweep keeps tech jargon out of user-facing copy (reads the keep/strip rules from memory).

## [10.142.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Plain-language sweep**: removed engineering/tech jargon from user-facing copy sitewide (transparency, index, about, faq, premium, and the changelog "For Learners" sections). "Live numbers from our Supabase database", "GA4", "axe-core / pa11y on every pull request", "service worker", "localStorage", "structured formats / API key" and similar were rewritten to what the reader actually gets, or removed where they only described plumbing. Meaningful terms kept (WCAG 2.1 AA standard, open-source, CC BY-NC-ND). Three deliberately-technical developer blog posts left intact (owner decision pending).
- **Transparency chart honesty**: the Course Engagement chart names its real basis — "the 12 most-used of the 41 courses that existed when this snapshot was taken (December 2025)" — so courses created after the legacy count aren't represented.

## [10.141.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Transparency page readability**: the Course Engagement chart (41 near-identical bars of rounded legacy estimates) now shows the top 12 with a caption explaining the numbers cluster because they're rounded; the Feature Adoption table drops its column of empty dashes (features that postdate the Dec 2025 snapshot move to an "Also live" line); "Active in last 30 days" now reads the real figure via `get_public_stats` v4 = `GREATEST(live 30-day count, owner floor 35)` — `last_active_at` only began being written on 2026-07-19, so the live count needed a floor until daily pings accumulate.

## [10.141.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Transparency live numbers corrected** (owner report: only "40 registered" was right). Root causes: engagement metrics were never backfilled into `public_stats_baseline`, and nothing wrote `profiles.last_active_at`. Now: `get_public_stats()` v3 returns all-time totals (baseline + live DB) per the documented methodology; owner's legacy numbers backfilled live (courses started 120,700; completed 727; certificates 468; learning minutes 785,160 — owner-approved estimate of 727 × ~18h); the card hides any metric whose total is 0 instead of presenting an uninstrumented zero as fact; `auth.js` pings `last_active_at` daily so "Active in last 30 days" measures something real.
- **Deploy webhook fallback** — `scripts/verify-deploy.py` polls for the production deploy of the merged commit and auto-triggers a manual Netlify build if the webhook is dropped (as happened to v10.141.0). Mandatory ship-checklist step in `rules/testing.md`.

## [10.141.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Self-hosted web fonts** — 59 woff2 files (variable where possible, latin+latin-ext) in `assets/fonts/` + `css/fonts.css`; 753 pages swapped off fonts.googleapis.com (845 links, 1,336 preconnects removed); Chromium-verified zero Google requests on 6 page types; Indic scripts keep system/on-demand fonts.
- **Per-page i18n dictionaries for intervention, nothing-about-us, nvc-rj** (5 languages) — the last three flagships without curated translations.

### Changed

- Course downloads cache the full course (entry + lexicon + shared render assets); offline downloads confirmed **free for everyone** (owner decision — matches all existing promises).
- 7 lexicon .xlsx files pulled from Dropbox into course dirs and repointed (openpyxl-validated) — external share links no longer a single point of failure; papers folders remain on Dropbox (all 19 links verified alive) under weekly link-rot watch.
- Game library: browser Back closes the game overlay instead of leaving the site.

### Fixed

- Livelihoods hero stats: FLFPR 32.8% (stale PLFS 2022–23) → 41.7% (PLFS 2023–24); informal-employment figure recited to ILO India Employment Report 2024. The Real Middle game now carries an honest sources note (PRICE ICE 360°, WID; stylised for gameplay).

## [10.140.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Game library search + difficulty filter** — search 135 games by title/topic, filter by Easy/Medium/Advanced (browser-verified).
- **Time-to-complete on all 18 flagships** — hero chips (modules × 1.5h) and `timeRequired` in every Course JSON-LD.
- **Structured data at the tail**: WebApplication JSON-LD on 31 studios, Article JSON-LD on all 22 Deep Dives + CollectionPage on the hub, CollectionPage on libraries.html.
- **libraries.html now shows what its description promised** — Deep Dives, Timelines, and Practice Packs cards plus a search affordance.
- **Blog conversion path** — honest, topic-matched course/catalog links on all 28 posts that had none.

### Changed

- Homepage: 13 nav accent links moved to WCAG-AA-passing shades (originals restored in dark mode); "New" badges legible (0.65rem) and capped at the two newest features; homepage stylesheet minified (225KB → 141KB).
- Duplicate 101 hub removed: decks.html deleted, 95 inbound links repointed, 301s in place; deck cards' "Includes quiz" overclaim reworded to "Self-check drills".
- Skip links on 28 studio/dive pages; hub back-links on the 12 studios missing them; mel-lab tab bar has real tab semantics.

### Decided

- No automated payment system, ever (owner decision — fees) — manual UPI remains the flow; "instant fulfilment" removed from the roadmap.

## [10.139.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Challenges feedback loop** — after submitting, learners score themselves against the challenge's weighted rubric (saved per device, browser-verified), and signed-in learners see their submission recorded to their account.
- **Verified-testimonials system** — `data/testimonials.json` + renderer with hidden mounts on premium/coaching/workshops/dojos (renders nothing while empty; verified, consented quotes only) and a consent-first "Share your experience" Netlify form on the premium page.
- **Dark mode on all 51 decks** — each deck already shipped a complete dark theme that was never wired to the site toggle or OS preference; the retrofit mirrors each deck's own dark rules under `html.dark`/`data-theme`/`prefers-color-scheme` (explicit light always wins), makes "System" actually follow the OS, and defaults first-time visitors to system preference. Verified in real Chromium across four scenarios; also fixed public-finance-budgeting's theme buttons, which threw a ReferenceError.

### Changed

- BookSummaries taxonomy re-cut: the 65-book "Policy & Social Protection" bucket split into Politics & Democracy (23), Caste, Gender & Society (15), Policy & Public Administration (11), History & Biography (10), Social Protection & Welfare (6); Design folded into Data & Design — 9 balanced, browsable shelves.
- Org dashboard's locked state now leads signed-out visitors to Sign In (was "buy a plan"); signed-in non-org users get an honest team-plan pitch.

### Fixed

- Two reading companions that ended mid-document (dalio-big-debt-crises, storytelling-climate-solutions) are properly closed and carry the library back-link footer.

## [10.138.0] - 2026-07-19

### Security & Critical Fixes

- **Password reset works again** — recovery emails pointed at a non-existent `/reset-password.html`; the page now exists (recovery-session gate → new-password form → confirmation, with an honest expired-link state).
- **Closed public PII exposure on `profiles`** — the certificate-verification RLS policy allowed anonymous reads of every column (phone, address, email). Replaced with a column-limited anon grant (id + name fields only), an org-peers policy for dashboards, admin read/update policies (admin updates were silently broken before), and a minimal invite-by-email RPC. Applied live and probe-verified; migration at `supabase/migrations/20260719_fix_profiles_public_exposure.sql`. Certificate queries now request explicit columns instead of `select=*`.
- **`/labs/` no longer serves the homepage** — lowercase studio URLs now 301 to `/Labs/`, the hub canonical is fixed, and 26 lowercase hub hrefs + homepage links normalized.
- **Law and SEL lexicons are real** — both were MEL-lexicon clones; replaced with authored Constitution & Law (52 terms) and Social-Emotional Learning (54 terms) lexicons. Media (66) and Power BI (64) lexicons de-duplicated to one canonical file each, old files removed, all links/redirects updated; MEL's Excel link now serves the local file instead of Dropbox.

### Added

- **Permanent live stats system** — `public_stats_baseline` table (seeded: 13,000 practitioners reached as of April 2026, per legacy Sheets + GA4 backfill) + upgraded `get_public_stats()` returning baseline, live counts, and an auto-growing `practitioners_total` (baseline + post-April registrations, no double-count). New `js/live-stats.js` fills any `[data-live-stat]` element; wired on the homepage, impact dashboard, and transparency page. Update the table row → the whole site follows.
- **Five maintenance Routines** (scheduled fresh-session agents): weekly backend/repo upkeep, weekly i18n maintenance, monthly page-by-page fact check, daily Supabase health + PII probe (with one allowed remediation), daily count-drift + analytics check.
- **Sitemap generator** — `scripts/build-sitemap.py` regenerates `sitemap.xml` from tracked files (738 URLs, up from 606; Handouts family included for the first time), honoring per-page noindex.
- **Site-wide search + offline** — the injected topbar now has a Search button (lazy-loads `js/search.js` everywhere) and registers the service worker on all ~775 chrome pages (was 23). The offline page is now self-contained and lists downloaded courses from the Cache API.
- **Conversion plumbing** — homepage email capture (prefills signup), mid-course sign-in nudge for signed-out learners with progress, phone now optional at signup, and step-2 profile extras survive the verification-email tab switch.
- **Security headers** — `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, HSTS site-wide; `frame-ancestors 'none'` on auth/account/admin pages (games/decks stay embeddable for classrooms).
- **Social cards** — branded 1200×630 default OG card replacing the square logo on 570 pages, plus per-course cards for all 18 flagships (16 had broken or generic images).

### Fixed

- Catalog, BookSummaries hub, and game-library counts are now **computed from their own data** (no more contradictory hardcoded numbers); Studios naming corrected in catalog stats/tabs; `aria-pressed` on all filter tabs; ItemList JSON-LD on the catalog.
- About page stats grid undersold the platform by half (48/11/16 → 69/35/135) and marked all five shipped languages "Coming Soon" — both corrected. FAQ numbers refreshed and the file added to the counts guard; FAQPage JSON-LD added.
- Legal pages corrected: Netlify Forms (not Formspree), Supabase/Netlify named as processors, children's age harmonized to 18 (DPDP), push notifications covered, dates bumped.
- 42 of 51 decks shipped a ~1MB ECharts bundle they never used — removed; Chart.js deferred on all 51. Every deck's end screen now has a "Continue your learning" block linking its matching Studio/flagship/game.
- Games: 16 boilerplate (8 truncated) meta descriptions rewritten, 13 dead-end games got back-to-library links, all 18 report completion to the game library (progress can finally reach 135/135), JSON-LD added, game-library error path fixed (`#cardGrid` → `#trackSections`).
- 166 reading companions got footer back-links (were dead ends); BookSummaries hub gained dark mode; off-template companions got missing metadata.
- Deep Dives filters rebuilt from actual tags (three filters used to show one card each); timelines + dataverse now honor the manual theme toggle; ImpactLex course stat de-hardcoded.
- 404 page: visible mojibake fixed, orphaned topbar fragment removed, stale count fixed; the mojibake guard learned the two signatures it was missing.
- Challenges copy is honest (realistic composite cases, self-assessment — no more unkept "expert feedback/badges/partner organizations" promises); "Partner:" labels → "Case setting:"; duplicate script loads removed; submission template prefills the textarea.
- Commercial pages: dojos theme buttons work (theme.js was never loaded) and skill cards are keyboard-accessible; coaching booking has a fallback link when Google's widget fails to load (plus chat XSS footgun fixed); workshops form labels associated; build-circles shows a real success message; teach.html got a canonical and lost 130 lines of template dead weight; account + org dashboards are `noindex`; org dashboard escapes user-supplied descriptions.
- Homepage JSON-LD said 17 flagships (now 18) and gained a SearchAction; gender course metadata de-boilerplated; blog JSON-LD gained `datePublished`/`dateModified` on all 33 posts; podcast's dead subscribe buttons replaced with honest copy; community page got canonical/OG tags.

## [10.137.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Live Database Numbers on the transparency page** — five tiles (registered learners, active 30d, courses started/completed, certificates) fed by a new anon-callable `get_public_stats()` Supabase RPC (aggregate-only, no row data), with honest framing that database tracking covers signed-in learners from 2026 onward. RPC SQL versioned in `supabase/migrations/20260719_public_stats_rpc.sql`.
- **Internal-link guard** — `scripts/check-internal-links.py` resolves every internal href/src across ~800 tracked pages the way Netlify does (pretty URLs, directory indexes, case-insensitivity, `netlify.toml` redirects, edge-function routes) and fails CI on rot. New `internal-links` job in `ci.yml`.
- **Certificate shares now unfurl properly** — a new `cert-og.ts` edge function rewrites the og:/twitter: tags on `/verify-certificate?cert=…` with the course name and recipient (same anon REST lookup the page makes), and a branded 1200×630 share card replaces the plain logo as the page's social image.

### Fixed

- **78 broken internal links** found by the new guard: 28 game/studio pages linked the non-existent `/Games/` directory instead of `/game-library.html`; 11 blog + course pages linked retired lab filenames (`toc-builder-lab` → `/Labs/toc-lab.html`, `sample-size-lab` → `/Labs/sampling-design-lab.html`); cookie-banner "Learn More" on about/faq/forgot-password navigated to a non-existent `privacy.html`; `Labs/toc-lab.html` back-links pointed at a non-existent `Labs/mel/`; `r-python-dev` linked the pre-move `code-converter-pro` path; the legacy Handouts pathways page linked bare track directories (now points at the handouts hub's track anchors); powerBI lexicon back-link targeted a non-existent `index.html`; dead "Download Excel" links removed from law/sel/media lexicons; `/deepdives.html` → `/DeepDives/`.

## [10.136.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **3 course lexicons** (livelihoods 53 / media 50 / powerBI 51 terms) from the mel lexicon template — all 18 flagships now have one; sitemap entries added; flagship tile updated.
- **JSON-LD at scale**: Course on 51 decks, LearningResource on 146 companions, BlogPosting on 33 posts (230 blocks, all validated).
- **Netlify email hooks** for 7 unwired forms (instructor-kit, product-order, event-registration, certificate-track-order, course-contribution, build-circle-waitlist, subscription-payment) → info@impactmojo.in.
- **i18n**: 9 Studios-era strings + 15 new menu labels translated in hi/bn/ta/te/mr.

### Changed

- **Images**: 105 files >100KB compressed in place (34MB → 18MB, 47%); logo 588KB → 56KB. Same filenames/formats.
- **Cache headers**: /assets/ 7d + SWR; /css/ /js/ 5min + SWR (no immutable — unhashed filenames).
- **Menus**: consistent ≤2-word labels across all menus; catalog premium labels unified as "Pro Studio".

### Fixed

- **a11y zeroed**: h4→h3 (founder/team/footer), skip links wrapped in nav landmarks (32 pages), WA FAB in aside landmark.

## [10.135.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **PR #817's stash-pop conflict markers** also corrupted `data/search-index.json` (invalid JSON — live site search was broken), `docs/changelog.md`, and `sitemap.xml`. All three resolved as proper merges: search index = Studios-renamed entries + the 15 new companions (921 total); changelog keeps both sides (their companion entry renumbered v10.134.2); sitemap = union of URL entries.

### Added

- `scripts/check-conflict-markers.py` + `conflict-markers` CI job — fails on `<<<<<<< `/`>>>>>>> ` markers in any tracked file. The pre-commit hook already checked this but hooks can be bypassed (`--no-verify`) or absent (unset hooksPath); CI cannot.

## [10.135.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **catalog.html**: default "All" view is now a grouped overview — one section per content type (6-card preview + "See all N →" that activates the type's filter tab). Card template extracted to `renderCardHTML`; filtered/search views unchanged.
- **101-courses/index.html**: 51 deck cards grouped under 6 learning-track headers (track mapping derived from catalog data); headers hide while filtering/searching (`body.deck-filtering`).
- **site-chrome.js**: WhatsApp share FAB stacks above the Mojini chat FAB (`bottom: 92px`) when a page has one — they previously overlapped bottom-right.

### Fixed

- courses/index.html hero tiles: 17→18 flagships, 224→233 modules, lexicons set to the verified 15.
- libraries.html: Reading Companions badge 105→149.
- 101-courses/index.html foot-cta: 16→18 flagships.

## [10.134.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- teach.html linked from site-chrome shared footer (every page) + homepage footer Learn column; site-chrome footer "Labs" label -> "Studios".
- Removed `nav-sampling-toolkit` from the homepage Specials menu (reachable via Studios/catalog/search).
- handouts.html stat tile counts HTML handouts only (89), matching the hero and canonical counts.

## [10.134.0] - 2026-07-19

### For Learners

- **Labs → Studios** — the 35 free workbenches renamed across the site (URLs unchanged).
- **Catalog fixed** — a JS syntax error had emptied the catalog page entirely; now renders all items, with self-deriving filter counts and 8 previously unlisted items added.
- **Smarter quiz** — a 6th experience question picks ONE primary next step (101 vs flagship); result persists and shows on the homepage.
- **Challenges as a difficulty ladder** — Start here / Build range / Test yourself sections.
- **Teach with ImpactMojo** — new instructor page (`/teach.html`) with kit-request form.

### Fixed

- **catalog.html**: unescaped apostrophe in a book-summary title broke the whole inline script → zero cards rendered. Filter-tab counts now computed from `allContent` at runtime.
- **open-badges.js**: `BADGE_CLASSES` covered 9/18 flagships — certificates for newer courses were skipped entirely in the badge wallet (no badge, no LinkedIn). All 18 + lowercase `sel` alias added; plain-list fallback in `account.js` also gets Add-to-LinkedIn.
- **PAGE-TEMPLATE.html**: `--gradient-primary` was only defined in dark-theme blocks → `.page-hero h1` invisible in light mode on template pages.
- Homepage founder cards enlarged (60→96px avatars, roomier layout).
- `101-courses/decks.html` hub: 47 → 51 native decks.
- Homepage tour: dead anchors replaced, stale counts fixed, indigo restyle; quiz copy 5→6 questions incl. i18n keys (5 languages).

### Changed

- **Sitewide display rename Labs → Studios** (37 Labs/ pages, index, catalog, tour, search-index, README, docs, press kit; URLs/ids/classes untouched). `check-counts.py` recognises the new phrasing and the homepage tile markup pattern. i18n note: renamed strings fall back to English pending the next translation pass.
- SEO: WebApplication + FAQPage JSON-LD on 5 high-intent studios.

## [10.133.0] - 2026-07-19

### For Learners

- **Course progress is now visible on every flagship** — progress bar, sidebar checkmarks and the completion flow now work across all 18 flagship courses.
- **Reading-time estimates** — each flagship module shows a ~minutes chip in the sidebar plus a whole-course total, computed from the actual module text.
- **Pick up where you left off** — a homepage shortcut back to your most recently touched unfinished flagship, with modules completed.
- **Offline downloads for the three newest flagships** — Designing What Works, Nothing About Us Without Us, and Nonviolence in Practice.

### Added

- **Content-count drift guard**: `data/counts.json` is now the single source of truth for content counts; `scripts/check-counts.py` lists every stale `"<n> <type>"` occurrence across 13 user-facing files (arrow-prose and `count-ignore` lines skipped) and is enforced in CI via the new `counts` job in `ci.yml`.

### Fixed

- **`js/course-progress.js` never initialized on DB-served courses**: it scanned for quiz modules at `DOMContentLoaded`, before `course-loader.js` had injected the content, and returned — so the progress bar, checkmarks and completion → certificate flow silently never appeared. It now re-attempts on the loader's `courseContentLoaded` event and exposes the `reinit()` hook the loader was already calling.
- **Progress disabled on 10 of 18 flagships**: `COURSE_NAMES` covered only 9 course ids (and `SEL` didn't match the lowercase `/courses/sel/` path). All 18 now covered.
- **Three flagships missing from offline downloads**: `intervention`, `nothing-about-us`, `nvc-rj` added to `js/offline.js` + `service-worker.js` (SW `VERSION` bumped v2 → v3).
- **Hero badge clipped under the fixed two-row desktop header** on the homepage; hero now clears it on ≥769px viewports.
- **Stale counts** across catalog meta (27→35 labs), transparency (68→69 courses, 31→35 labs), README (courses/flagship/labs/Deep Dives), FAQ and platform overview (16→18 flagship).

### Changed

- **First-visit calm on the homepage**: floating tool widgets (speed dial, share button, floating language globe) are hidden on a visitor's very first pageview only; all later pageviews are unchanged.
- **`.v3-btn-primary`** recolored from off-palette magenta to the brand primary gradient (`#667eea → #764ba2`) with matching border/shadow.

## [10.83.0] - 2026-07-13

### For Learners

- **LogFrame Builder — a new free lab that turns your Theory of Change into a donor-ready Logical Framework.** Climb the results ladder from Goal to Activities, attach SMART indicators and their means of verification, surface the assumptions that hold your logic together, then print or export the classic 4×4 LogFrame matrix. It imports directly from the Theory of Change Builder, so you don't start from a blank page — and there's a worked example to learn from. No sign-in; your work saves to your own browser and works offline. Open it at /Labs/logframe-builder-lab.html.

### Added

- **`Labs/logframe-builder-lab.html`**: a self-contained interactive LogFrame builder. Five guided steps (Problem & Goal → Results Ladder → Indicators → Means of Verification → Assumptions) assemble a 4×4 matrix (Goal / Outcomes / Outputs / Activities × Narrative / Indicators / MoV / Assumptions). One-click import from the Theory of Change Builder (reads the saved `impactmojo_toc_builder` state and maps impact→Goal, outcome→Outcome, output→Output, activity→Activity, assumption nodes→assumptions). Export to Markdown, JSON (re-importable), or print/PDF in landscape. Auto-saves to `localStorage`; brand-consistent styling with light/dark support. Registered in `data/search-index.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `Labs/index.html`, and `docs/labs-guide.md`. Lab count updated 31 → 32.

## [10.82.2] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **Check what you've learned — every flagship now ends with a self-check.** All 15 flagship courses now finish with a six-question auto-graded self-assessment (90 questions in all), each grounded in that course's own material. Pick an answer, check it instantly, and read a short explanation of the reasoning. No sign-in, nothing stored.

### Added

- **Course assessments on all 15 flagships**: a `#course-assessment` section with 6 auto-graded multiple-choice questions each, grounded in the course's own modules (e.g. theory of change / attribution / OECD-DAC for MEL; visual encoding / graphical integrity for DataViz; AI limits / bias / accountability for AI for M&E; counterfactual / selection bias / DiD for Causal; median voter / rent-seeking / Arrow for Public Choice; SLF five capitals for Livelihoods; intersectionality / GII for Gender; star schema / DAX / RLS for Power BI; and so on across Gandhi, Law, Media, Politics of Aspiration, Public Policy, SEL, DevEcon). Each question carries a per-question teaching explanation via a `data-explain` attribute. Most courses already shipped the quiz CSS + `checkAnswer()` JS unused; where a course was missing the JS (Livelihoods, Gender, Public Policy) or the base CSS (Gender, Public Policy, Power BI), the standard, self-contained pattern was ported in using that course's own design tokens.

### Fixed

- **Dangling "Assess Yourself" navigation links** on the Data Visualization and AI for M&E flagships — the sidebar linked to a `#course-assessment` anchor that had never been built, so the link jumped nowhere. Now resolved (and every other flagship gained a matching "Assess Yourself" link + section).

### Changed

- **Nav placement**: moved **AI for M&E Certificate** from the Services dropdown to **Learn** (after Flagship Courses) on the homepage — it's a self-paced assessed credential, not a facilitated service. **Build Circles** stays in Services.

## [10.82.1] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **AI Agents for Evaluators — shipped ahead of schedule.** The Certificate Track's promised module is live now, not in August: what an AI agent actually is, five agents worth building in M&E work (reporting assistant, indicator tracker, data-quality reviewer, qualitative coding assistant, follow-up nudger), two complete no-code build walkthroughs with copy-paste prompt templates, the ethics non-negotiables, and the capstone brief. Free to read at /ai-agents-for-evaluators.html.
- **Build Circles and the Certificate Track are now easy to find** — in the catalogue (new Programs filter), the homepage services menu, and the premium and products pages.

### Added

- **AI Agents for Evaluators module** (`/ai-agents-for-evaluators.html`, 692 lines): 6 sections, ~3,000 words, sticky scrollspy nav, per-section progress persistence, 2 MCQ self-checks, copyable prompt blocks, capstone rubric (weights sum 100). Certificate-page card flipped from "August 2026" to "Available now" with a link. Registered in search index and sitemap.
- **Programme cross-referencing**: catalog.html gains a Programs (2) filter chip + entries; homepage services nav links both programmes; premium.html Programs card; products.html Programs section; updates.html launch card; docs/premium.md + docs/platform-overview.md sections.

## [10.82.0] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **Build Circles — four-week AI build cohorts.** Pick a real M&E problem (yours, or one of our 15 Live Case Challenges), build a working AI workflow with a small matched cohort on a weekly rhythm, and demo it on Demo Day. Joining the waitlist is free; the ₹1,000 seat deposit is paid only when your circle is scheduled — and comes straight back to you when you demo, along with a verified certificate. Facilitated by Dr. Varna Sri Raman and Vandana Soni. Rolling cohorts — join at /build-circles.html.
- **AI for M&E Certificate Track (₹2,499).** A self-paced, assessed track: a guided path through the AI for Impact course, the Counterfactual game, the full Critiquing Evidence practice pack, a real-work capstone reviewed with written feedback, and a verified certificate you can prove online — at a fraction of the price of comparable international certificates. An AI Agents for Evaluators module joins the track in August at no extra cost.

### Added

- **Two new programme pages** (`/build-circles.html`, `/ai-for-me-certificate.html`): brand chrome, canonical theme system, Netlify forms (`build-circle-waitlist`, `certificate-track-order` with hidden product field + WhatsApp fallback), decode-verified UPI QR assets (₹1,000 deposit, ₹2,499 track), FAQ blocks, and mutual cross-links; wired into search index and sitemap. Both pages Playwright-smoke-tested (render, theme flip, form fields, QR load, zero page errors). Design note: both builds independently flagged that `assets/css/light-mode-fallback.css` (an invert-filter hack for dark-only pages) corrupts genuinely two-theme pages — one page neutralises it, one omits it; a future sweep should stop shipping it on two-theme pages.

## [10.81.1] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **What Would Have Happened Anyway? The Counterfactual Habit** — a new plain-language blog post on counterfactual thinking for non-statisticians: four traps that fool boards and funders (regression to the mean, self-selection, survivorship, confounding shocks), the hierarchy of honest evaluation designs, and three questions to ask of any impact claim. Pairs with the Counterfactual game and the Causal Inference course.

### Added

- **Blog post #32: The Counterfactual Habit** (`/blog/counterfactual-habit.html`) — Methods post with two inline hand-drawn-style SVG diagrams (counterfactual gap, four-traps 2×2; napkin.ai placeholders), cross-linked to the Counterfactual game, Causal Inference course, Live Case Challenges, and the Critiquing Evidence practice pack; registered in search index (BLOG059), sitemap, blog.html card grid; blog count 31 → 32.
- **Visual-regression harness stabilised** (`tests/visual/`, gates issue #563): all 36 snapshots now deterministic (external hosts route-blocked, clock/random frozen, motion disabled) — double-green verified; the stage-1 `@layer` wrap of `imx-main.css` was attempted and cleanly reverted by the gate, with the blocking `!important`-inversion mechanism documented on #563 for stage 2. Runs in remote agent sandboxes (Chromium is available there).

### Fixed

- **Accessibility backlog cleared (issue #360): 679 WCAG 2.1 AA errors → 0** across 26 audited pages — 14 course lexicons (497 errors), 3 handout files (74), 5 premium tools + premium.html (108), and the dataverse cluster. Mechanical fixes only: same-hue AA-compliant contrast tokens (light theme; dark values explicitly preserved), aria-labels on unlabeled search/filter/form controls (including tor-builder's JS-generated rows), and removal of two hourly `meta refresh` tags on static glossaries (WCAG 2.2.1). Every touched page re-audited to zero; no visual restructuring.
- **Gender lexicon rendered zero terms** — the same unguarded `theme-` element lookup as the course page threw on load and killed the entire render script; guarded, and the page now renders all 683 term elements with no JS errors.

## [10.81.0] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **Blog theme controls unified — the last of the theme-key sprawl.** All 31 blog posts replaced their legacy two-state sun/moon cycle toggle (which wrote a legacy localStorage key that shared `/js/theme.js` silently overrode on the next load) with the canonical 3-mode System/Light/Dark selector bound to `theme.js`. `js/cookie-ui.js` now writes only the canonical `im-theme` key (legacy-key read-migration kept). Gated per file on script-syntax checks and zero residual references; 5 diverse posts Playwright-verified (toggle flips theme, choice persists across reload). Net −227 lines of duplicated inline code.
- **`/courses/` and `/games/` now serve their real landings** (courses gallery and the Game Library) instead of rewriting to the homepage — same defect class as `/labs/`, fixed in v10.80.1.
- **Gender course crashed a script on every page load** (`setTheme()` looked up a nonexistent `theme-<name>` element → `null.classList`); guarded, page now loads with zero JS errors.

### Changed

- **Homepage sprite**: 85 repeated literal inline SVG icons deduplicated into 13 `<symbol>` definitions; screenshot-gated (4 viewport/scroll pairs ≥ 99.97% identical, matching the pristine-control diff exactly), all inline scripts byte-identical.
- **Dependabot queue cleared**: the 7 remaining open dependency PRs closed as superseded (main's lockfiles already carry equal-or-newer versions of every target after v10.80.1); the repo has zero open PRs.

## [10.80.2] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **New Deep Dive — Platform & Gig Work in India**: 26 annotated readings on India's gig economy — how big it really is, what the work feels like, the new laws (Rajasthan's 2023 Act, the Social Security Code), the global debate, and how gig workers are organising. Pairs with the Livelihoods course and the Gender & Work timeline.
- **What's New page refreshed** — the updates feed now covers everything shipped this month: the 12 new labs, the R & Python course, the Counterfactual game, all 15 challenges, and the new timeline.

### Added

- **Deep Dive #21: Platform & Gig Work in India** (`/DeepDives/platform-gig-work-india.html`) — 26 readings across 5 sections (sizing, worker experience, law & regulation, global frames, organising); registered in deep-dives.json v1.2.0, search index, sitemap; count swept 20 → 21 sitewide.
- **Desktop sidebar-collapse chevron on gender + devai flagships** (the last two courses missing it), with per-course palettes, localStorage persistence, and mobile-drawer protection; Playwright-verified at 1440px and 390px.

### Fixed

- **SEL course's sidebar chevron was dead** — markup id `sidebar-collapse` vs JS looking up `sidebar-collapse-btn`; one-line fix, verified collapsing/restoring.
- **Three blog posts had a truncated topbar transplant** (`meal-demystified`, `theory-of-change-pitfalls`, `why-impactmojo-exists`) that buried unusable Browse/Premium/theme controls under the header; orphan fragment removed (blog chrome is the header bar), pages verified in headless Chromium.
- **catalog_data.json regenerated** from the canonical catalogue (97 → 224 entries — the admin dashboard was missing 54 book companions and whole content types); missing 6th timeline added to the catalogue (chip 5 → 6); admin games label 134 → 135.
- **Final emoji pass**: chatbot menu icons in PAGE-TEMPLATE, marketing-kit download arrows, and the products-page bulb replaced with inline SVGs; stale "400+ handouts" claim on products.html corrected to real counts.

### Changed

- **Theme-convergence sweep ran with hard gates and migrated zero pages by design** — all 29 remaining inline-theme blog pages use a two-state cycle toggle that requires a deliberate redesign rather than mechanical migration (documented for the future pass); the sweep's gates caught and auto-reverted 3 attempted migrations and surfaced the broken-topbar bug above.

## [10.80.1] - 2026-07-06

### For Learners

- **All 15 flagship courses can now be downloaded for offline use** — the offline download list previously covered only 9 courses; Gender, Public Choice, Public Policy, Causal Inference, Livelihoods, and Power BI are now included.
- **Site search now finds every course** — the Gender and Public Policy flagships and the Inequality Basics 101 deck were missing from search and are now indexed.

### Fixed

- **Systemic `/labs/` → `/Labs/` case mismatch** across the search index (32 URLs), sitemap (30 URLs), `netlify.toml`, and `_redirects` — individual lab URLs relied on Netlify's case-insensitive serving and would 404 on any case-sensitive host. The bare `/labs/` URL now serves the 28-lab gallery (`Labs/index.html`) instead of rewriting to the homepage.
- **Search-index hygiene**: added the missing `gender` and `pubpol` flagship entries and the `inequality-basics` 101 deck; removed a duplicate lab entry (`LAB-SSC`); fixed a `deepdive` type typo (now `special`); index at 767 entries.
- **Monthly newsletter counts were wrong**: the intro derived "courses" from the raw search-index type count (106, which includes practice workbooks); it now derives flagship + foundational = 62, and the fetch-failure fallbacks were updated from 16/11/49 to 18/28/62 games/labs/courses.
- **`api-docs.html` was stuck in one theme** — no toggle and no `theme.js`; it now carries the standard 3-mode toggle, and the paper-plane motif was added there and on `events.html`, `verify.html`, and `peer-review.html`.
- **`Games/sel-simulation-game.html`** was the only game bypassing the shared harness, reading a single legacy theme key; it now loads `game-shell.js` + the canonical `theme.js`.
- **Count contradictions** fixed on `transparency.html`, `catalog.html` (134 vs 135 games), and `updates.html` ("five" → six timelines); README flagship table now lists all 15 courses, the game list includes all 18 simulations, and Telugu joins the language lists.
- **Malformed HTML tag** in status-alert emails (`status-probe.mjs`); misleading route comment in `devdiscourses.ts`.

### Added

- **Four new documentation guides** — Timelines, Research to Action, Practice Packs, and Deep Dives (`docs/*.md`, wired into the GitBook TOC), closing the gap where whole content types had no guide.
- **Schema capture migration** (`supabase/migrations/20260706_capture_subscriptions_and_profile_sync.sql`): the `subscriptions` + `subscription_payments` tables and the `profiles` cloud-sync columns existed only in production; a fresh environment can now reproduce the backend.
- **Service worker v2-2026-07-06**: offline course downloads for all 15 flagships (`service-worker.js` + `js/offline.js`); behaviour test PASS.

### Changed

- **docs refresh**: `docs/changelog.md` synced to v10.80.0 (the newsletter parses it), `docs/content-catalog.md` fully regenerated (was listing 7 book summaries vs 55), `docs/platform-overview.md` + `docs/getting-started.md` now cover timelines/practice packs/challenges/Research to Action/R & Python/status page, both roadmap files reconciled.
- **Security**: `npm audit fix` on root + mcp-server lockfiles (0 vulnerabilities remain); devDeps bumped to dependabot targets; 2 dependabot PRs merged (actions/checkout v7, hono), superseding the other 10.
- **Dead code removed**: 4 orphaned JS files with zero references (`assessments.js`, `assessment-data.js`, `mobile-ui.js`, `token-gate.js`, ~79 KB).

## [10.80.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **New game — Counterfactual: The Evaluation Game** (`/Games/counterfactual-game.html`, game #18). You are the evaluation lead at an Indian NGO consortium: eight scenarios (a Bihar remedial camp, an SHG income claim, a scholarship cutoff, a phased immunisation drive, skilling completers, a CLTS spillover design, an ICDS monitoring bump, and a drought-year endline), each hiding one classic causal-inference trap — regression to the mean, self-selection, ignoring natural experiments, placement bias, survivorship bias, spillovers, the observer effect, and confounding shocks. Score 0–3 per round on design judgement (the strongest *feasible* design, not always an RCT), with plain-language feedback and a trap recap. Warli-style intro art (the counterfactual village as the faded mirror of the real one), keyboard shortcuts, best-score persistence, full brand chrome. Game Library: 134 → 135 (18 simulations + 117 puzzles); wired into the library, catalogue, search index, sitemap, and games guide.

- **Six new Live Case Challenges — every flagship course now has one** (`data/challenges.json` 9 → 15, each with a 2-document case packet under `/challenges/<id>/`): *Stress-Test an Impact Claim* (causal — audit a water programme's "43% reduction" claim and design next year's identification strategy from a rollout plan that quietly contains one), *Spec an Honest Power BI Dashboard* (powerBI — star schema, Power Query plan, DAX measures and layout from three messy education data sources), *Design a Graduation Pathway for Ultra-Poor Households* (livelihoods — 24-month graduation pilot in Banka, Bihar with real unit economics), *Diagnose the Incentives Behind a Failing Procurement System* (pubchoice — six years of late textbooks read through principal-agent, rent-seeking, and collective-action lenses), *Manage a Donor Exit Without Wrecking the Programme* (poa — an 18-month bilateral exit in Madhesh, Nepal), and *Draft a Policy Memo Before the Window Closes* (pubpol — a Kingdon-framed midday-meal memo for a new minister's first 100 days). Hub stat and `docs/challenges-guide.md` updated to 15.
- **New timeline — Gender & Work in India, 1931–Today** (`/timelines/gender-work-india.html`, 6th timeline): 18 citation-backed nodes across 6 eras — Foundations & Promises (Karachi Resolution, Maternity Benefit Act, *Towards Equality*), Making Women's Work Visible (SEWA, DAWN, Shram Shakti), Liberalisation & Its Contradictions (feminisation debate, Vishaka, first Time Use Survey), Rights-Based Expansion (MGNREGA, NCEUS, POSH Act), The Participation Puzzle (falling FLFPR, the 26-week amendment), and Codes, Platforms & the Care Economy (labour codes, COVID shock, platform work, the disputed post-2020 revival). Each node carries Argued/Mattered/Critique sections and cross-links to the Gender flagship, Care Economy 101, the FLFPR Deep Dive, and labs. Timelines landing page now shows 6 live / 113 nodes / 44 eras.

### For Learners

- **Counterfactual: The Evaluation Game** — a new 10-minute game where you face eight real-world impact claims and pick the evaluation design that answers "what would have happened anyway?" Learn to dodge the eight classic traps that fool funders and boards — no statistics background needed.
- **Six new Live Case Challenges** — every flagship course now has a matching real-world challenge: stress-test an impact claim, spec a Power BI dashboard from messy data, design a graduation pathway for ultra-poor households, diagnose why textbook procurement keeps failing, manage a donor exit in Nepal, and draft a policy memo before a political window closes.
- **New timeline: Gender & Work in India, 1931–Today** — 18 landmark moments in how Indian women's work has been promised, protected, erased, counted, and contested — from the Karachi Resolution to SEWA, MGNREGA, the POSH Act, and today's care-economy debates.

### Fixed

- **26 blog posts and 4 book companions are now searchable.** Only 5 of 31 blog posts had ever been added to `data/search-index.json`; the other 26 (the entire Learning Loops back-catalogue — ToC pitfalls, sample size, participatory MEL, quasi-experimental designs, and more) were invisible to site search. Added them (`BLOG033`–`BLOG058`) along with the 4 book companions that joined the catalogue in v10.79.12 but never reached the index (Health Economics/Kobelt, Unlimited Memory, Public Health Equity & Ethics, Using Python for Introductory Econometrics — `BS51`–`BS54`). Search index: 733 → 763 entries.
- **The Handbook of Social Protection companion is now in the catalogue** (it was on the site and in search, but missing from `catalog.html`). Book Companions chip 54 → 55.
- **Stale counts corrected sitewide** after the early-July labs expansion: 15 → 27 labs, 60 → 62 courses, 45 → 47 foundational, 54 → 55 book companions, 28 → 31 blog posts across README, premium, upgrade, transparency, content-marketing kit, catalogue meta description, and 13 docs pages. README no longer claims "4 native + 36 Gamma-hosted" foundational decks — all 47 are self-hosted native HTML.
- **`docs/labs-guide.md` now documents all 27 labs** (it listed only 12 under a "The 15 Labs" heading). The 16 missing labs — Survey Design, Ethics & Research Integrity, Participatory Methods, Data Feminism, Systems Thinking, Conflict-Sensitive Programming, Climate Risk & Adaptation, Grant Writing, Stakeholder Mapping, Policy Analysis, Policy Brief Writing, Budget & Fiscal Analysis, DPI, Gender Analysis, Teacher Evidence Explorer, and R & Python for Development — are grouped into four sections with descriptions and links.

## [10.79.13] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- **Foundational course count corrected to 47 (total 62).** The advertised figure had been 45 foundational / 60 total, but `/101-courses/` actually has **47 built decks**. Updated foundational/total counts to **47 / 62** across the homepage, README, press kit, catalogue, transparency page, premium pages, content-marketing kit, signup/invite emails, status/products pages, upgrade page, docs, and CLAUDE.md. Also cleaned up stale **flagship** counts on live pages — homepage "12 Flagship Courses" → 15, and the press-kit ("53 Courses / 13 Flagship") and premium ("13 Flagship / 40 Foundational") stat blocks → 62 / 15 / 47. (Historical changelog and internal-log mentions of older counts were left intact as accurate records.)

### Added

- **Catalogue now lists all 47 foundational courses** (was 40, of which several were stale). Converted 7 "Coming Soon" placeholders that are in fact built (Survey Design, Gender Mainstreaming, Mixed Methods, Impact Evaluation, Maternal Health, Child Development, Feminist Research), removed a duplicate Development Economics entry (repurposed to Political Economy 101), and added 7 absent decks (Advocacy Basics, Behaviour Change Communication, Climate Essentials, Data Visualization, Inequality Basics, Logframe, Women's Economic Empowerment). Filter chip 40 → 47.

## [10.79.12] - 2026-06-23

### Changed

- **Language switcher moved into the top navigation.** It was a floating globe at the bottom-right (near the learning-tools dial). `translate-sarvam.js` now mounts the globe inline in the topbar (`.im-topbar-right`, or `.nav-buttons` on the homepage) — but only when that target is visible, so it falls back to the floating globe where the nav cluster is hidden (e.g. the homepage on mobile) and is never lost. The menu drops down in-nav. Applies across all ~380 pages from the one shared script.

### Added

- **Research to Action surfaced across the site:** a card in the homepage "Free Resources" grid, a **Poster Series** type in the catalogue (`catalog.html`, 7 entries + filter chip), the top-nav Specials dropdown, and the shared translation layer so it switches languages like every other page.

### Fixed

- **Homepage resources grid no longer shows empty slots.** The fixed 3-column grid left blank cells on the last row (7 cards); it's now `auto-fit`, so a partial last row stretches to fill.
- **Count reconciliation across surfaces.** Press kit corrected from a stale "48+ Courses · 15 Flagship · 38 Short" to "60 Courses · 15 Flagship · 45 Short"; catalogue handout count corrected 85 → 84 (actual). Homepage, README, press kit, and catalogue now agree on the canonical figures (60 courses · 13 labs · 134 games · 20 deep dives · 54 book companions · 84 handouts).
- **Catalogue brought up to date with the site.** Corrected stale filter-chip counts (Labs, Games, Deep Dives, Premium) and added the entries that were missing from the catalogue: the **Policy Analysis Lab** (labs 12 → 13) and four book companions — **Health Economics (Kobelt)**, **Unlimited Memory**, **Public Health Equity and Ethics**, and **Using Python for Introductory Econometrics** (book companions 50 → 54). The catalogue now matches the canonical counts.

## [10.79.11] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Research to Action posters were cropped on mobile.** The spotlight image used `object-fit: cover`, which cut off the left/right edges of the (square) posters on narrow screens — only the middle column showed. Switched to `width:100%; height:auto` so the full poster always renders.

## [10.79.10] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Research to Action — Series 5, 6, and 7** (30 posters). Three more series added to the multi-series album via new `SERIES` entries + `posters/series-5|6|7/` (PNGs re-encoded to ~1.5 MB each in optimized JPEGs + thumbnails):
  - **Series 5 — Climate, Health & Resilience:** climate as a health issue, heat action plans, WASH, food & nutrition, vector-borne disease, resilient health systems, early warning, gender & equity, urban heat/air pollution, adaptation to resilience.
  - **Series 6 — Home Truths** (development-sector realities): capacity building, the last mile, dashboards vs decisions, pilots vs scale, real participation, innovation vs improvement, reporting vs learning, frontline workers, evidence theatre, systems change.
  - **Series 7 — Policy & Programme Design:** problem definition, policy levers, targeting, implementation systems, frontline delivery, incentives, cost-effectiveness, accountability, political economy, public value.
  - Deep-links `#5-<n>`, `#6-<n>`, `#7-<n>`; search index gains `RTA005`–`RTA007`. The album now hosts 7 series / 70 posters.

### For Learners

- **Three new poster sets on Research to Action** — *Climate, Health & Resilience* (Series 5), *Home Truths* on how development work really plays out (Series 6), and *Policy & Programme Design* (Series 7). Switch between all seven series at the top of the album.

## [10.79.9] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Research to Action — Series 4: "Research Methods Without Panic"** (10 posters). Fourth series in the multi-series album (new `SERIES` entry + `posters/series-4/`, ~2 MB optimized JPEGs + thumbnails). Topics: sampling, sample size, survey design, validity, reliability, qualitative interviews, focus groups, coding qualitative data, mixed methods, and research ethics. Deep-links `#4-<n>`; search index gains `RTA004`.

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Research Methods Without Panic" (Series 4)** on the Research to Action page: ten posters demystifying core methods — sampling and sample size, survey design, validity and reliability, qualitative interviews, focus groups, coding, mixed methods, and research ethics.

## [10.79.8] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Research to Action — Series 3: "Evaluation in Practice"** (10 posters). Added to the multi-series album via a third `SERIES` entry and `posters/series-3/` (PNGs re-encoded to ~1.6 MB of optimized JPEGs + thumbnails). Topics: theory of change, evaluation questions, process evaluation, outcome evaluation, contribution analysis, equity-focused evaluation, realist evaluation, implementation failure, rapid evaluation, and evaluation reporting that gets used. Deep-links `#3-<n>`; search index gains `RTA003`.

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Evaluation in Practice" (Series 3)** on the Research to Action page: ten posters on doing evaluation well — from theory of change and asking the right evaluation questions to process/outcome evaluation, contribution analysis, equity and realist evaluation, diagnosing implementation failure, rapid evaluation, and reporting people actually use.

## [10.79.7] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Research to Action — Series 2: "Data to Decisions"** (10 posters). The `/research-to-action/` album now hosts multiple series with a series switcher above the spotlight; the filmstrip, counter, deep-links, and download adapt to the active series. Series 2 covers data quality, triangulation, monitoring, dashboards, administrative data, data ethics, inclusive evidence, learning loops, qualitative data, and data storytelling. Posters are namespaced into `posters/series-1/` and `posters/series-2/` (Series 1 files moved accordingly; source PNGs re-encoded to ~1.5 MB of optimized JPEGs + thumbnails). Deep-links are now `#<series>-<poster>` (e.g. `#2-3`), with bare `#n` kept for Series 1. Search index gains `RTA002`.

### For Learners

- **New poster set — "Data to Decisions" (Series 2)** on the Research to Action page: ten posters on turning data into good decisions — quality, triangulation, monitoring, dashboards, ethics, inclusion, learning loops, qualitative insight, and storytelling. Switch between series at the top of the album.

## [10.79.6] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Research to Action — poster series** (`/research-to-action/`). A new visual section with a wide central spotlight/lightbox album: a large featured poster, prev/next + keyboard navigation, a thumbnail filmstrip, click-to-zoom fullscreen lightbox, per-poster download, and `#n` deep-links. **Series 1** ships with 10 posters — What is Research to Action?, Start with the Right Question, Choosing the Right Research Design, Sample Size, Indicators That Measure What Matters, Five Common Biases, Correlation/Causation/Credibility, How to Read Findings Without Being Misled, From Findings to Decisions, and Communicating Research So People Use It. Source PNGs (~21 MB) were re-encoded to optimized JPEGs + thumbnails (~2 MB total). Brand shell (topbar, theme toggle, footer), search index (`RTA001`), sitemap, and homepage footer link added.

### For Learners

- **New "Research to Action" poster series** — a visual walk through turning research into decisions and impact, from asking the right question to communicating findings people actually use. Browse the spotlight album, open any poster full-size, or download them for your own workshops and classrooms.

## [10.79.5] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Web push notifications.** Learners can opt in (per device) on the account page to receive browser push notifications for streak and cohort-deadline reminders, extending the existing email + in-app notification system (#145). New pieces: a `push_subscriptions` table + `notification_preferences.push_enabled` column (migration `20260621_push_subscriptions.sql`); a `send-push` Supabase Edge Function (save/delete subscription + VAPID-signed delivery via `web-push`, dead-subscription pruning); `push`/`notificationclick` handlers in the service worker; a `js/push-notifications.js` opt-in module (VAPID public key, permission + subscribe flow); and a toggle in the account-page Notifications card. The `send-notification` function now also fires a best-effort push (wrapped so it never blocks email/in-app) on streak and cohort events. Backend (table, VAPID secrets, both functions) is deployed and smoke-tested on Supabase; the front-end opt-in goes live on the next `main` deploy.

## [10.79.4] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Rebuilt service worker — offline support without stale files.** The previous SW had been reduced to a self-unregistering stub (`js/pwa.js` actively cleared registrations) after a stale-cache bug. The new `service-worker.js` is **network-first for HTML/navigations** (always fresh online, cached fallback or `/offline.html` only when the network fails) and **stale-while-revalidate for static assets** (CSS/JS/images/fonts/JSON), with versioned caches purged on `activate` so a deploy can never serve stale files. It also wires up the previously-dead `js/offline.js` features: on-demand course download (`CACHE_COURSE`) and **background sync** of queued learner progress (`sync-progress`). User-downloaded course caches persist across SW versions. `js/pwa.js` now registers the SW (with prompt-free skip-waiting on update) instead of unregistering it.

### Fixed

- **Deep Dives count corrected to 20** on `premium.html` (3 places said "17") — matches `data/deep-dives.json` and the homepage. (Site-wide audit: courses 60, labs 13, games 134, book companions 54, handouts 84 all consistent.)

## [10.79.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Climate Action Challenge game now has a real light theme** — it was the last dark-only page, relying on a global filter-invert fallback that turned its warm Warli earth-tones cold and muddy in light mode. Replaced with a designer-authored light palette (warm sand surfaces, espresso-brown folk-art ink) wired to the existing 3-button system/light/dark toggle. The folk-art SVG line illustrations (hard-coded cream `#F5F0EB` ink) now flip to brown on the sand background, the literal-dark gauge track lightens, and the page no longer loads `light-mode-fallback.css`. All games now have a genuine light theme.

### For Learners

- **The Climate Action game looks right in light mode** — warm, readable sand-and-brown colours that match the rest of the site, instead of the previous washed-out inverted look.

## [10.79.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Case packets for all 9 Live Case Challenges** — each challenge in `data/challenges.json` now points at real downloadable resources under `/challenges/<id>/` instead of `#` placeholders. 24 new brand-styled, `noindex`, print-friendly HTML documents plus 6 datasets (CSV), built to be internally consistent with each challenge's case context (e.g. the flawed logframe contains its 5 documented flaws; the AI-targeting dataset exhibits the four described biases; the two nutrition interventions' cost breakdowns reconcile to their per-child figures). The `challenges.js` renderer already shows a real link when a resource URL is present, and the placeholder "coming soon" rendering remains as the fallback.

## [10.78.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Five new interactive book companions** — Poor Economics (Banerjee & Duflo), Why Nations Fail (Acemoglu & Robinson), Development as Freedom (Sen), Capital in the Twenty-First Century (Piketty), and India After Gandhi (Guha). Each mirrors the data-driven `debraj-ray-companion.html` template (chapter accordions, concept cards, practitioner takeaways, South Asia lens, Gemini Q&A). Cross-referenced into `BookSummaries/index.html`, `data/search-index.json` (BS46–BS50), `sitemap.xml`, `catalog.html` (bs46–bs50), and the docs.

### Changed

- **Theory of Change Workbench relabelled free** — the self-hosted `/toc-workbench.html` was mislabelled "Premium"/"TOC Workbench Pro" in `catalog.html`, `catalog_data.json`, and `data/search-index.json` despite being fully open. The genuine paid Pro tool is the external workshop-pro app; the catalog premium card now points there.
- **Book-companion counts corrected** to 54 across `premium.html`, `README.md`, `upgrade.html`, `content-marketing-kit.html`; catalog filter to 50; BookSummaries index category chips corrected to true card counts (pre-existing drift).

### Fixed

- **Gated four ungated Pro tools** — `rq-builder` and `tor-builder` (→ Practitioner), `qual-insights-lab` and `code-converter-pro` (→ Professional) were fully usable signed-out via direct URL while only the homepage cards were locked. Added the `advisory-board-pro.html` gate pattern (`#lockGate`/`#liveTool` + `hasTierAccess`).
- **~20 broken internal links** — challenge resources and Dataverse skill items no longer render dead `#` links; capitalized `/Labs` & `/Games` directory links now redirect; corrected wrong BookSummary filenames (gog/dt/info-we-trust/storytelling-with-data), course-link case mismatches (`/courses/Gender`, `/courses/MEL`), the `course-catalog.html` back-link, five dead practice-pack flagship-course links, a missing ToC lab path, and a wrong-case SEL redirect target.

## [10.64.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — Site-wide multilingual support (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi)

### For Learners

- **Every page is now available in हिन्दी, தமிழ், বাংলা and मराठी** — a language
  switcher on all 377 pages translates the whole site (courses, 101 decks,
  blogs, deep dives, book summaries, essays) on demand, with the proper Indian
  script fonts. Switch back to English instantly. Powered by Sarvam (Mayura).

### Added

- **`netlify/functions/translate.mjs`** (`/api/translate`) — Sarvam translation
  proxy with a Netlify Blobs cache (each unique string translated once per
  language, then served from cache; API key server-side only).
- **`js/translate-sarvam.js`** — the client switcher: progressive batch-by-batch
  DOM translation with per-user `localStorage` cache, Noto script fonts, a
  MutationObserver for dynamically-loaded content (flagship modules), a
  brand-name keep-list, and a "translating…" indicator.
- **`scripts/translate/`** — the translation pipeline + a paced cache pre-warm
  tool.

### Fixed

- Translation reliability on heavy/cold pages — small batches (fit the Netlify
  function timeout) + progressive apply (render as you go, not all-at-once).

## [10.63.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — Marginalia essay 3 + 101 hub completion + count reconciliation

### For Learners

- **The Indicator Ate the Village** — the third Marginalia cartoon essay: ten
  drawings on monitoring & evaluation (the baseline that learns nothing, the
  dashboard at 87% beside an empty clinic, real-time-data-for-whom, the endline
  that never saw the year after exit, accountability that only points up), each
  with cited, evidence-based paragraphs.
  `/specials/the-indicator-ate-the-village/`
- **Climate Essentials 101** and **Inequality Basics 101** now appear in the
  101 Series hub (they were native decks sitting outside the grid).

### Changed

- **101 hub** now lists **45 native course decks** — added Climate Essentials +
  Inequality Basics and removed the duplicate "Economics for Policy
  Practitioners" card (it pointed at the Development Economics deck), so the hub
  matches the Deck Library gallery exactly.
- **Site-wide counts reconciled** to 15 flagship · 45 foundational · 60 total ·
  134 games · 13 labs · 49 book summaries · 17 deep dives · 84 handouts ·
  18 practice packs — across English pages, the Supabase signup/invite emails,
  the GitHub profile README, and the bn/mr/hi/ta documentation.

## [10.62.0] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed — Mobile rendering

### For Learners

- **101 course decks now display correctly on phones** — slides previously
  collapsed to a tiny portrait sliver on mobile; they now fill the screen width.

### Fixed

- **All 45 native 101 decks + the `build.py` donor** — `.slide-viewport` was a
  `flex-shrink:1` child of the `display:flex` `#deck`, so on any screen narrower
  than 1280px it shrank its width while height stayed fixed, collapsing the 16:9
  stage into a scaled-down portrait sliver. Added `flex-shrink:0`. Verified in
  headless Chromium (viewport 412px: stage width 412→1280, slide aspect
  0.57→1.78).
- **`faq.html`** — mobile breakpoint hid `.nav-links` but not the `.nav-buttons`
  theme/auth cluster, causing a 73px horizontal overflow; hidden on mobile +
  `overflow-x:hidden` safety net.

### Added

- **`scripts/mobile/audit.py`** — headless-Chromium harness that flags
  horizontal overflow across key pages (exit 1 = CI-gateable). Audit: 24/25 key
  pages already pass at 390px.

## [10.61.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series: 5 more native decks; ZERO Gamma embeds remain

Migrates the last 5 Gamma-embedded 101 decks to native 100-slide HTML and
surfaces 4 catalog-only courses in the 101 hub (40 → 44 listed courses; 37

  Economy, WEE); counts now Native 37 / Slide Deck 0; series total 40 → 44;
  hero stat "3,700 Slides of Learning".
- **`data/search-index.json`** — `course` entries for the 5 additional decks.

## [10.60.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series native migration COMPLETE: Governance & Economy (4 decks)

The final cluster lands. **All 26 ImpactMojo 101 courses that were embedded
Gamma decks are now self-hosted native 100-slide HTML decks** — joining the 7
pre-existing native decks for **33 native decks, 0 Gamma embeds**.

### For Learners

  fundraising. 100 slides.

### Changed

- **`101-courses/index.html`** — the last four cards re-badged Native HTML;
  counts now Native HTML 33, Slide Deck 0.
- **`data/search-index.json`** — `course` entries added for all 26 migrated
  decks so they surface in site search.

## [10.59.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series native migration: Critical & Digital cluster (5 decks)

### Changed

- **`101-courses/index.html`** — six cards re-badged Native HTML · 100 slides;
  counts updated (Native HTML 17 → 23, Slide Deck 16 → 10). Adds
  `scripts/deck-builder/rebadge.py` to keep card badges and counts in sync.

## [10.57.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series native migration: Data & Methods cluster complete (5 decks)

Five more 100-slide native decks finish the Data & Methods cluster (10 of the
26 Gamma courses now migrated).

### For Learners

- **Econometrics 101** — measuring causal effects, not just correlations:
  the counterfactual, OLS and omitted-variable bias, RCTs, instrumental
  variables, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and panel
  fixed effects — with the assumptions each one rests on. 100 slides, 7 charts.
- **Multivariate Analysis 101** — multiple regression and beyond: partial

- **`101-courses/index.html`** — five cards re-badged Native HTML · 100 slides;
  counts updated (Native HTML 12 → 17, Slide Deck 21 → 16).

## [10.56.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series native migration: Data & Methods batch (4 decks)

Four more 101 Series courses move from Gamma embeds to native 100-slide decks,
built with the `scripts/deck-builder` pipeline.

### For Learners

- **Bivariate Analysis 101** — relationships between two variables: cross-tabs,
  scatterplots, correlation (Pearson & Spearman), comparing groups, chi-square,
  simple regression, and the classic pitfalls (confounding, ecological fallacy,
  Anscombe, Simpson's paradox). 100 slides, 8 charts.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis 101** — making sense of household survey data

  ICMR 2017 guidelines and the DPDP Act 2023: consent, vulnerable populations,
  privacy, risk–benefit, ethics review, and giving findings back. 100 slides.

### Changed

- **`101-courses/index.html`** — the four cards re-badged Native HTML · 100
  slides; counts updated (Native HTML 8 → 12, Slide Deck 25 → 21).
- Every deck is now hard-enforced at exactly 100 slides, with TOC section
  ranges auto-computed by the builder.

## [10.55.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added — 101 Series native migration: Data Literacy 101 + deck builder

Begins migrating the ImpactMojo 101 Series from embedded Gamma slide decks to
self-hosted, native HTML decks. First deck shipped: **Data Literacy 101**.

### For Learners

- **Data Literacy 101** — a 99-slide native course on reading, questioning,
  visualising and using data responsibly: India's data ecosystem (Census,
  NFHS, PLFS/NSS), turning concepts into indicators, describing and visualising
  data, correlation vs causation, sampling and surveys, data cleaning, reading
  statistics critically, and data ethics, privacy & equity. Charts, tables and
  diagrams throughout; light/dark themes, keyboard & swipe navigation, free
  forever.

### Added

- **`101-courses/data-lit.html`** — native gold-standard deck (replaces the
  Gamma embed), 99 slides, 7 charts. Self-contained: inline theme switcher,
  viewport scaling, lazy chart init, deep-linking and auto-fit.
- **`scripts/deck-builder/`** — a reusable deck generator. Authors write a
  compact Python spec (`specs/<slug>.py`); the builder slices the proven shell
  (CSS + runtime JS) out of `dev-economics.html` and injects the generated
  slides, slide-IDs and chart code, so every deck inherits identical styling
  and behaviour. Includes `build.py`, `_schema.md` and the Data Literacy spec.

### Changed

- **`101-courses/index.html`** — Data Literacy card re-badged Native HTML ·
  99 slides; counts updated (Native HTML 7 → 8, Slide Deck 26 → 25).
## [10.54.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed — Causal Inference flagship: gold-standard content rewrite (all 13 modules)

- Rewrote every module's `content_html` and deployed it to the production
  `course_content` table (course_id `causal`). Each module now has KaTeX math,
  an inline DAG/plot, a worked Indian-programme example with a results table,
  R + Stata code, a common-pitfalls callout, a problem set with collapsible
  solutions, and current references. Per-module content roughly doubled in
  depth (≈6 KB → 9–16 KB).
- `courses/causal/index.html`: KaTeX wired (earlier) + new styled components
  (`worked-example`, `problem-set`, `dag-figure`, `assumption-list`).
- `js/course-loader.js` (earlier): fetch timeout + retry so modules no longer
  hang on a slow edge-function response.
- Content pipeline: `supabase/seed-content/causal/` per-module source files;
  `scripts/build-causal-seed.py` rebuilds the seed migration; `scripts/
  deploy-causal.py` deploys to prod via the Supabase Management API.

## [10.53.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added — Marginalia series hub + second essay "The Fine Print"

- **`specials/the-fine-print/index.html`** (new) — second Marginalia cartoon
  essay, 10 panels with the "pitch / reply" device and two–three cited
  paragraphs each, plus a 19-item Notes & Sources list. Themes: co-creation/
  tokenism (Arnstein), ownership vs budget (participatory budgeting), disability
  access (RPwD Act 2016 / CRPD), youth tokenism (Hart), unpaid "volunteer"
  labour (WHO), lifestyle drift / commercial determinants (WHO), evidence vs
  budget (Cairney), dashboard vs service (Jal Jeevan Mission, Goodhart),
  maintenance vs innovation (Vinsel & Russell), resilience vs root causes
  (*At Risk*).
- **`specials/marginalia/index.html`** (new) — series landing hub with cards
  for both essays; BreadcrumbList + CollectionPage JSON-LD.
- **`assets/images/the-fine-print/`** — 10 cartoons optimised to progressive
  JPEG (~2.8 MB); **`assets/images/marginalia-cover.jpg`** series cover.
- **Cross-refs** — homepage Specials section now shows both essays and links
  to the hub; nav "Marginalia" repointed to `/specials/marginalia/`;
  `search-index.json` (+2), `catalog.html`/`catalog_data.json` (Specials → 2),
  `sitemap.xml`, and the podcast companion callout updated to the series.

## [10.52.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added — New Special: "Capacity for Irony" (Marginalia)

A new content type — **Specials** — debuts with its first entry, a
**Marginalia** piece (illustrated satire with cited evidence) at
`/specials/capacity-for-irony/`.

- **`specials/capacity-for-irony/index.html`** (new) — self-contained,
  brand-compliant page (fixed topbar, 3-mode theme toggle, 4-section footer,
  skip link, GA, paper-plane, Article JSON-LD). Ten cartoons laid out as
  alternating panels; each pairs the "pitch / reply" exchange with two–three
  evidence-based paragraphs and inline citations, plus a 17-item numbered
  Notes & Sources list. Notebook-paper palette with a blue-ink accent echoing
  the artwork.
- **`assets/images/capacity-for-irony/`** (new) — 10 cartoons optimised from
  ~24 MB PNG to ~2.5 MB progressive JPEG (1000px wide), lazy-loaded with full
  alt text.
- **Cross-references** — added to the homepage Specials → Long-form Reading
  menu (`index.html`), `data/search-index.json` (type `special`),
  `sitemap.xml`, and both changelogs.

## [10.34.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added — Practice Packs premium (freemium paywall)

Practice Packs move from fully free to a freemium model: the first two modules
of every pack remain a free preview; modules 3–4 plus the capstone builder
require access.

- **`js/practice-pack-gate.js`** (new) — reusable client-side freemium gate.
  Wraps the shared `goTab(idx)` entry point so every tab and nav button is
  gated with one drop-in. Themed paywall modal offers three paths: Practitioner
  subscription (₹399/mo, all 18 packs), standalone single pack (₹299), and an
  optional expert review (₹999). Config per pack via `window.IM_PACK`.
- **All 18 packs** wired with the gate (`freeModules: 2`).
- **Standalone purchase support** — `profiles.resource_grants TEXT[]` column
  (migration `20260602_add_resource_grants.sql`, GIN-indexed). `auth.js` selects
  it and exposes `ImpactMojoAuth.hasResourceAccess(slug)`; `state-manager.js`
  caches it; the gate unlocks a pack if the user's tier qualifies OR the slug is
  in `resource_grants`. Admin grants the slug after UPI, matching the existing
  manual registration flow.
- **`premium.html`** — Practice Packs added to the Practitioner tier card and
  detail; registration form gains "Practice Pack (single) – ₹299", "Practice
  Pack + Expert Review – ₹1,298", and "Practice Pack Expert Review – ₹999"
  options plus a conditional pack-name field; `?pack=<slug>` deep link
  preselects the standalone option and prefills the pack; new FAQ entry.
- **`upgrade.html`** — Practice Packs added to the Practitioner offer.
- **`practice-packs/index.html`** — reframed from "Free" to free-preview +
  premium; **search-index** landing description updated.

## [10.28.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added — Complete Practice Packs series (16 new) + blog rewrite

**16 new interactive Practice Packs** completing the full series (18 total):

Subject Packs (7 new):
- PP-S3 Gender Impact Assessment Design
- PP-S4 Education Programme Evaluation
- PP-S5 Health Intervention Evaluation
- PP-S6 Climate Adaptation Programme Evaluation
- PP-S7 Public Policy Evaluation
- PP-S8 Media Campaign Evaluation
- PP-S9 Governance Reform Evaluation

Method Packs (9 new):
- PP-M1 Writing a ToR That Gets You Useful Research
- PP-M2 Designing a Survey Instrument
- PP-M3 Building a Logframe That Actually Tracks
- PP-M4 Costing a Programme from Activities Up
- PP-M5 Running a Real Focus Group Discussion
- PP-M6 Reading & Critiquing an Evidence Paper

All follow interactive pattern: localStorage auto-save, progress bar, MCQ self-checks, live capstone builder ("Build my brief" pulls module answers into compiled markdown), copy/print export. No emoji — Sargam SVG icons. India-context throughout. Dark mode support.

Landing page (`/practice-packs/`) updated with all 18 pack cards in Subject + Method tracks. `data/search-index.json` +16 entries (total 562). `sitemap.xml` +16 URLs.

### Fixed

- **Blog "Evidence-Based Pivots" rewritten with real named cases + citations** — reader (Ashwani, M&E practitioner) asked for sources. The three stories were composites. Rewrote with: (1) India's ICDS system (Gragnolati et al. 2005, World Bank); (2) JEEViKA Bihar (Datta 2015, *World Development*); (3) Pratham TaRL pivot (Banerjee et al. 2017, *JEP*). Same arcs, real names, inline source blocks.
- **All emoji removed from every new page** — replaced with Sargam-style inline SVGs across all 9 files from the session (186 emoji in SEL game alone). Practice Packs landing stripped of "v2 callout" and stub cards.

## [10.27.0] - 2026-05-23

### Practice Packs v2 — Interactive lab-features + Subject/Method tracks + PP02 Livelihoods Evaluation

Cofounder feedback: (1) the PP roadmap looked all-SEL because PP01 was the only live subject pack — felt narrow; (2) labs and handouts outperform courses because they're interactive — Practice Packs should work like labs, not like static reading. This release addresses both.

**Landing page (`/practice-packs/`) restructured into two tracks**:
- **Subject Packs** (9 — per-domain evaluation design): SEL ✓, Livelihoods ✓, Gender, Education, Health, Climate, Public Policy, Media, Governance
- **Method Packs** (9 — cross-cutting toolkit skills): ToR (Next), Survey, Logframe, Costing, FGD, Critiquing Evidence, Stakeholder, Donor Reporting, MEL from Scratch
- The SEL pack is now visibly one of 9 subject packs, not the lead identity

**PP01 SEL Evaluation — retrofitted with interactive lab-features**:
- In-browser form-based template editor (textareas + radios) replacing the static copy-to-clipboard `<pre>` blocks
- localStorage auto-save (no login; data stays in browser; explicit privacy claim)
- Progress bar shows % complete + per-module completion state
- 4 self-check MCQs (one per module) with reveal-the-answer + feedback
- Live capstone builder: click "Build my brief" → pulls all module answers into a compiled markdown brief
- Export: copy as markdown / print as PDF / contenteditable for in-place refinement
- Reset button (with confirmation) to clear progress

**PP02 Livelihoods Evaluation Design — new Subject pack, shipped with full interactive features**:
- Module 1: SLF + outcome dimension choice (income / asset / capability / vulnerability)
- Module 2: PLFS/NRLM/SECC-aligned instrument selection with India national-data comparability
- Module 3: Sampling + seasonal calendar + migration coding protocol
- Module 4: Disaggregated analysis + shock-attribution + the "Krishna question" framing
- Capstone: 1-page Livelihoods Evaluation Design Brief
- 4 self-check MCQs; same interactive pattern as PP01

**Cross-references**: search-index (PP01 updated, PP02 added — type `practice-pack`), sitemap (livelihoods URL added).

## [10.26.2] - 2026-05-23

### Added — napkin.ai diagrams for the accessibility blog post

`/blog/making-accessible-websites.html` was the last blog post on the site using only inline SVG figures rather than napkin.ai PNG diagrams (cofounder feedback called it out as the holdout). Brought it in line with the rest of the blog.

- **Illustration 1** — replaces the inline SVG bar chart of the 5-pass trajectory (393 → 77 → 21 → 14 → 1 → 0). Same data; cleaner napkin progress-tile design with both percentage reductions and absolute counts shown.
- **Illustration 2** — new diagram added at "Lesson 2: small number of root causes" section, illustrating the five common root causes (missing alt text, low colour contrast, improper form labels, missing skip links, missing ARIA attributes) that account for ~80% of WCAG violations across most sites.
- The two remaining inline SVGs (Brand colours vs WCAG comparison table; Six-step starter checklist) intentionally kept as inline SVG — they contain precise data (specific Tailwind colour codes, contrast ratios, numbered step actions) that napkin's summarisation would not preserve faithfully.

## [10.26.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added — napkin.ai diagrams for "Knowing What You Want" blog

The blog post shipped in v10.25.0 had no illustrations (platform convention is 2 per post). This PR fixes that gap.

- **Illustration 1** — Six substitutes for wanting, stacked precariously like a tower. The fragility-of-substitution metaphor.
- **Illustration 2** — Seven honest questions as stations on a winding path. The 90-minute exercise.
- Added `.napkin-figure` CSS (was missing).

## [10.26.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added — Practice Packs series launched

**New content type**: ImpactMojo Practice Packs — short, focused 3-hour sprints that take practitioners from a job-to-be-done to a finished artefact. Sits between blog posts (one-shot read) and flagship courses (multi-week commitment). The format contract:

- 4 modules, ~25 min each
- ~2 hours reading + 1 hour exercise = ~3 hour total commitment
- Each module: short read + worked example + exercise + downloadable template
- Capstone: produce one concrete artefact (a ToR, drafted survey, logframe, eval design, etc.)
- Take-home pack of all templates

**New section**: `/practice-packs/` — landing page lists all packs (1 live, 9 upcoming).

**First Practice Pack**: `/practice-packs/sel-evaluation/` — "SEL Evaluation: Design & Instruments" (PP01).
- Module 1: What kind of evaluation do you actually need? (3 dimensions)
- Module 2: Choosing your measurement approach (CASEL / SEE Learning / WHO Life Skills / NCERT AEP / ACER India / behavioural / direct assessment)
- Module 3: Designing the data collection (sample sizes, per-unit costs in 2026 ₹, consent architecture)
- Module 4: Analysis, reporting, and the honest framing
- Capstone: 1-page SEL Evaluation Design Brief
- 5 downloadable copy-to-clipboard templates throughout

**Upcoming Practice Packs** (listed on landing page):
PP02 ToR Writing · PP03 Survey Instrument · PP04 Logframe · PP05 Costing · PP06 FGD · PP07 Critiquing Evidence · PP08 Stakeholder Mapping · PP09 Donor Reporting · PP10 MEL from Scratch

**Cross-references**: `data/search-index.json` (PP-LANDING + PP01, new type `practice-pack`), `sitemap.xml` (2 URLs), `index.html` (nav link with "New" badge).

## [10.25.5] - 2026-05-23

### Added — Framework diversity propagated to SEL Course and SEL Eval Deep Dive

After bringing framework plurality to the SEL Simulation Game (#433), audited the SEL Course and SEL Evaluation Deep Dive — both had the same CASEL-heavy, NEP-child-only gaps. This PR fixes both.

**SEL Flagship Course (`/courses/SEL/`)**:
- Hero subtitle now names CASEL, SEE Learning, WHO Life Skills, Delhi Happiness Curriculum + EMC, Indian indigenous traditions (Tagore, Krishnamurti, Aurobindo, Nai Talim), and NEP 2020 teacher-side provisions (NPST, CPD, B.Ed., teacher autonomy)
- New static "Frameworks We Draw From" section inserted between hero and Module 1, explicitly mapping each framework's relevance with India-context notes
- Sidebar nav updated with link to the new section
- Meta description, keywords, OG description updated for SEO
- *Note*: Course module content itself is dynamically loaded from Supabase edge function; this PR updates only the static shell. Full integration of framework references into individual module bodies would require database updates outside this repo.

**SEL Evaluation in India Deep Dive (`/DeepDives/sel-evaluation-india.html`)**:
- Section 01 (Foundations) — added 4 new entries:
  - SEE Learning (Emory + Dalai Lama Centre)
  - NCERT Adolescence Education Programme (AEP) — the framework Indian government schools actually run
  - Indian indigenous educational traditions (Tagore, Krishnamurti, Aurobindo, Nai Talim)
  - Expanded NEP 2020 entry to explicitly include teacher-side provisions (NPST, 50-hr CPD, 4-yr integrated B.Ed., teacher autonomy)
- Section 02 (India Evidence Base) — added entry for Delhi's Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC) alongside the existing Happiness Curriculum entry; deepened the Happiness Curriculum annotation
- Reading count updated 28 → 32 (in HTML, `data/deep-dives.json`, and the homepage Deep Dives card)

## [10.25.4] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **SEL Simulation Game: Parent mode (5th mode).** Replaces "Four Lenses" with "Five Lenses". Six new rounds drawn from Indian parenting + adolescent mental-health evidence:
  - The withdrawn child at dinner (early-warning response)
  - The teacher complaint about your son (parent-teacher partnership)
  - The friend who turned on your daughter (relational coaching)
  - The day you snapped (rupture-and-repair modelling)
  - The school SEL programme arrives (NEP-aligned parent engagement)
  - Boards + a peer self-harming (warm-handoff to professional support)
- Parent mode tracks 4 dimensions: Trust, Wellbeing, Connection, Modeling. 5 archetypes. End-screen summary including India-specific adolescent mental-health helplines (iCall, Vandrevala, MANAS).
- Welcome SVG updated with parent figures (violet).

### Changed

- **Framework diversity acknowledged.** Game was CASEL-heavy. Now explicitly references **SEE Learning** (Emory + Dalai Lama Centre, India-translated), **WHO Life Skills** (the framework actually under-girding most Indian state curricula), Delhi's **Happiness Curriculum** + **Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC)**, and Indian indigenous traditions (Tagore, Krishnamurti, Aurobindo, Nai Talim). Updated intro card, "Why X modes?" card, and several scenario insights to reflect this plurality.
- **NEP 2020 teacher-side provisions** woven into Teacher and Designer endEvidence summaries — NPST (National Professional Standards for Teachers), 50-hour annual CPD mandate, 4-year integrated B.Ed., teacher autonomy. Previous text framed NEP almost entirely from the child-facing side.
- Score dimensions, scenario card, choice grid all extended to support 5th mode (violet color tokens, m5 score card, b5 bar, scenario-card.parent, parent .btn-choice).
- Cross-references updated: search-index `GAME017`, index.html courses modal card, catalog.html g17 entry.

## [10.25.3] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **ToR blog post: removed duplicate illustrations.** The inline SVG fallbacks were rendering alongside the napkin.ai PNGs (default `display: inline-block` was applied unconditionally, not only via `onerror`), producing the impression of figures back-to-back with no text in between. Removed all 4 inline SVG fallbacks now that real napkin.ai PNGs exist for every figure.
- **Diagram 4 (research types) is now a real napkin.ai PNG** — generated successfully on the third prompt attempt (clean mismatches list). Previous versions either collapsed the 3×3 matrix to 3 pills or used over-creative metaphors that lost the content.
- Removed dead `.napkin-figure svg` CSS rule.

### Changed

- Updated alt text on all 4 figures to reflect they are napkin.ai diagrams.
- Tightened figcaptions on figures 3 and 4 since the diagram now does more of the storytelling.

## [10.25.2] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **New section in ToR blog post:** "What Kind of Research Do You Actually Need?" — addresses the second-most-common cause of failed research engagements (asking for the wrong *type* of research). Covers three dimensions:
  - **Question type**: outcome evaluation vs process tracing vs theory-based evaluation
  - **Evidence type**: quantitative vs qualitative vs mixed-methods (and why mixed is consistently under-budgeted)
  - **Time dimension**: cross-sectional vs pre-post vs longitudinal vs retrospective
- Includes 3 common mismatches we see weekly and a closing callout requiring a one-line statement of the design choice on all three dimensions before finalising the methods section.

### Changed

- **3 of 4 blog diagrams upgraded to real napkin.ai-generated PNGs** (illustration-1 Anatomy of ToR, illustration-2 Budget Tiers, illustration-3 Process Cycle). Inline SVG fallbacks remain via `onerror` handler.
- **Diagram 4 (research types) deliberately uses the inline SVG** rather than a napkin PNG — napkin's summarisation collapsed the 3 dimensions × 3-4 options + 3 mismatches structure into a 3-pill graphic each time it was re-prompted; the inline SVG preserves the full matrix.
- Updated blog-card excerpt and search-index description to reflect the expanded scope.

## [10.25.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Blog post: How to Write a ToR That Gets You Useful Research** at `/blog/writing-a-tor-for-research.html` — practical guide for development sector clients on writing Terms of Reference / Scope of Work / RFP documents to obtain research from agencies like ImpactMojo. Covers the 9 ingredients of a good ToR, 5 anti-patterns, India 2026 budget benchmarks (₹2L/₹10L/₹40L tiers, day rates by seniority, where the money actually goes), 5 common budgeting mistakes, and a pre-send checklist.
- 3 inline SVG napkin-style diagrams: (1) anatomy of a good ToR, (2) what ₹2L/₹10L/₹40L buys, (3) ToR-to-research pipeline with failure points. PNG fallback paths at `assets/images/blog/writing-a-tor-for-research/illustration-{1,2,3}.png`.
- Entries in `data/search-index.json` (BLOG031), `sitemap.xml`, `blog.html` card.

## [10.25.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **SEL Simulation Game** at `/Games/sel-simulation-game.html` — four-mode game (teacher, program designer, evaluator, student) on Social-Emotional Learning in Indian schools. Evidence-grounded scenarios drawn from NEP 2020, CASEL, WHO life skills, and India-specific SEL research 2015–2024. ~24 evidence-backed scenarios across the four modes, each with explicit "what the evidence shows" reflection.
- **Teacher Evidence Lab** at `/Labs/teacher-evidence-lab.html` — filterable evidence base of 30+ teacher-effectiveness interventions (TaRL, contract teachers, mentoring, structured pedagogy, cascade training, multi-grade pedagogy, Mindspark, pay-for-performance, etc.). Filter by evidence quality, cost, type, outcome, and India relevance. Each card includes honest summary including weak/null findings.
- **SEL Evaluation in India — Deep Dive** at `/DeepDives/sel-evaluation-india.html` — 28-reading working syllabus across 7 sections: foundations, India evidence base, measurement, design choices, operational wisdom, critiques, and an opinionated "what works, what doesn't" summary.
- **Knowing What You Want — Blog Post** at `/blog/knowing-what-you-want.html` — reflection on the foundational step of knowing what you want before building theory of change. Includes 90-minute 7-question exercise.
- **Livelihoods in India: Rural, Urban, and Skills — Flagship Course** at `/courses/livelihoods/` — comprehensive 3-module flagship: rural livelihoods (NRLM, SHGs, MGNREGA, agriculture, financial inclusion), urban livelihoods (informal sector, vendors, gig economy, domestic workers, urban policy tools), skills (Skill India evidence, apprenticeships, women's labour force participation puzzle, job matching, returns to training). ~15,000 words. Practitioner-level, India-centred, evidence-driven.
- Entries in `data/search-index.json` (5), `catalog_data.json` (livelihoods), `data/deep-dives.json` (SEL eval), `sitemap.xml` (5 URLs).

### Changed

- Content counts sitewide:
  - Games: 16 → 17
  - Courses: 52 (12 flagship + 40 foundational) → 53 (13 flagship + 40 foundational)
  - Labs: 11 → 12
  - Deep Dives: 5 → 6

Updates made to `index.html`, `catalog.html`, `docs/changelog.md`. Other count references in `docs/` files may still show old numbers — to be swept in next housekeeping pass.

## [10.23.38] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Timeline era headers no longer overlap card content.** The original v10.23.35-36 design used `position: sticky` on `.era-header` which caused the "01 / 02 / 03" era numbers to sit on top of node cards as users scrolled. Removed sticky positioning; era headers are now inline section breaks.

### Changed
- **Timeline cards now use progressive disclosure** (matches reference site behaviour). Cards are collapsed by default showing year + title + author + chevron. Click anywhere on the card to expand the Argued / Mattered / Critique sections + cross-links. Click again to collapse. Reduces the wall-of-text feel that made timelines hard to scan.
- **Era jump-nav added** (sticky pill bar below topbar) — click an era name to smooth-scroll to that section. Replaces the old filter chips that hid eras (jump is more intuitive than filter for sequential reading).
- **Era headers redesigned** as inline flex (marker + title + years pill + blurb below) — cleaner than the previous stacked layout with the absolutely-positioned marker.
- **Vertical timeline rail removed** — no longer needed without sticky positioning; visual hierarchy now comes from the era headers + card grouping.
- Deep-link via `#n-...` still works AND auto-opens the target node when the page loads.

### Why
User: "the format of the timelines is not working. it's hard to read and understand. pls look at the original example shared and try to emulate just using our brand and fonts. also the sections 01 02 03 etc are overlapping the text content."

Applied to all 5 timelines (Development Thinking, Indian Policy, MEL & Methods, Climate Policy, Indian Rights) via single CSS+JS override block.

## [10.23.37] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Timelines added to main site navigation** under Specials → Long-form Reading (alongside Book Companions and Deep Dives). Single-line addition to `index.html`'s nav-specials dropdown — `/timelines/` now reachable from every page on the site without needing to know the URL.

## [10.23.36] - 2026-05-03

## [10.23.34] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Auto-fit JS was truncated across all 7 native decks** during a prior merge conflict resolution — only the opening comment marker remained, with the entire `autoFit` IIFE body deleted. Re-injected the full `autoFit` function so proportional zoom-on-overflow works again. Lowered the floor from **0.85x → 0.78x** so genuinely overflowing slides scale further before "give up and overflow" — fonts can shrink to ~12px (still readable) before allowing visible cutoff.
- **Stale agenda count in social-margins s2**: "What We Cover in 110 Slides" → "What We Cover in 123 Slides" (deck has been at 121 then 123 slides for some time; agenda was never updated).

### Added — universal fit tightening (all 7 decks)
- Consistent slightly-tighter base spacing applied across every slide so most content fits naturally without needing zoom. **No font-size changes** — only padding, margins, and line-height adjustments. This is the "broad CSS rule" the user asked for.
  - `.slide-content` padding `24px 40px 20px` → `18px 36px 16px` (saves ~10px vertical, 8px horizontal)
  - `.slide-title.md/.sm` margin-bottom `10/8 → 6/4px` (saves ~4px each)
  - `.bullet-list` gap `10 → 7px`, line-height `1.55 → 1.5` (saves ~10px on long lists)
  - `.hbox` padding `14 → 11px`, hbox-text line-height `1.55 → 1.45` (saves ~6px each)
  - `.term-box` padding `18px 22px → 14px 18px`
  - `.dark-card` padding tightened (saves ~4-6px each)
  - `.col-panel`, `.stat-card` padding tightened
  - `.ctable td/th` padding `10→8px`, line-height `1.4` (saves ~4-8px per row across long tables)
- Net effect: every slide gets ~30-50px more usable vertical space than before, so most content fits naturally. Auto-fit zoom only kicks in for genuinely dense slides.

## [10.23.33] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Social Margins 101 — split overflowing s117 + s118 into 4 slides total**. User confirmed both reading list (s117, 26 items) and glossary (s118, 24 terms) overflow at full font size; user said "break for both."
  - **s117** now: "Where to Go Next — Primary Indian Sources & Data" — 10 items split into 2 columns (foundational documents | surveys & data).
  - **s118** (NEW): "Where to Go Next — Major Scholarly & Literary Works" — 16 items split into 2 columns (foundational thinkers | modern scholarship + literary voices).
  - **s119** (was s118): "Working Glossary I — Cross-cutting & Caste" — 12 terms (Intersectionality, Subaltern, Recognition vs Redistribution, Brahmanical patriarchy, Varna/Jati, Dalit, Adivasi/ST, Bahujan, Pasmanda, NALSA, Section 377, Hijra).
  - **s120** (NEW): "Working Glossary II — Identity Vectors & Acts" — 12 terms (Brahmanical patriarchy × sexuality, RPWD Act 2016, Social model, Communalism, Sub-nationalism, Untouchability, Endogamy, SC/ST/OBC/EWS, PoA Act 1989, Mandal, Manual scavenging, Honour killing).
  - **s121, s122, s123** — renumbered from s119/s120/s121 (MPI chart, Scavenging chart, End slide). Total slides now 123 (was 121).

## [10.23.32] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Social Margins 101 — duplicate s121 slide removed**. User flagged slides 119, 120, 121 all "blank". Investigation revealed s120 and s121 were duplicate "Manual Scavenging Deaths" chart slides (both with canvas `id="sm_scavenging_deaths"`) — likely from a merge resolution that didn't dedup properly. Since ECharts can only initialize one canvas per ID, the second instance was always blank. Removed s121, renumbered End slide s122 → s121, updated SLIDE_IDS array, fixed end-byline mention. Total slides now 121.
- **Chart slides showing blank on first view across all 7 native decks**. ECharts canvases initialize when the deck loads — but only the first slide is `display:flex`; all others are `display:none`. A canvas inside a hidden parent has 0 width at init time, so ECharts creates the chart but renders to a 0×0 canvas. When the user navigates to the chart slide, the canvas now has dimensions but no resize event fires, so the chart stays blank. Fix: added `MutationObserver` on `.slide.active` class changes that calls `echarts.getInstanceByDom(canvas).resize()` for every chart canvas in the newly-active slide. Initial pass at 400ms ensures even the deck's first chart slide (if active at load) renders properly.

### Known follow-ups (not in this PR)
- **Slides 117 + 118 in social-margins overflow** — s117 has 26 list items (Where to Go Next reading), s118 is a 4898-char working glossary table. Both need editorial trim or split. Will scope per slide.
- **Slides 2, 55, 113 reported as "mostly blank"** — these all have content in source (TOC, table, bullets respectively); user reporting them as blank may be a rendering issue separate from the chart fix above. Need user re-check post-deploy to confirm.

## [10.23.31] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Proportional auto-fit rule** across all 7 native decks. User asked: "No content exceeds the viewport dimensions without shrinking font too much and also without allowing overflow." Implementation: at slide-active change, JS measures `slide-content.scrollHeight` vs `clientHeight` — if natural content exceeds available space, applies CSS `zoom` to scale the entire slide-content down proportionally (fonts, padding, margins, and image dimensions all shrink together so visual hierarchy is preserved). Hard floor at **0.85x** (max 15% reduction) so fonts stay readable (~13px minimum on a 15px base). Below that scale, the slide is allowed to overflow rather than become unreadable — signal that the slide genuinely needs editorial trimming.
- **Compared to v10.23.22's auto-compact**: that approach used selective font-size reductions (only some elements got smaller, breaking visual hierarchy) and went all the way to 11px ultra-compact. The new auto-fit is proportional (everything scales together) and capped at a 15% reduction, so it never makes text unreadable.
- Deck behaviour: most slides need no scaling. A few slightly-overflowing slides scale to ~0.92-0.97x (visually almost identical to base). Heavily overflowing slides (those that needed `.compact` or `.ultra-compact` in v10.23.22) overflow visibly — flagging them for content trim.

## [10.23.30] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Slide deep-linking via URL hash** across all 7 native decks. The URL now updates as you navigate (`#s1` → `#s2` → ...). Pasting a deep-link URL like `https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/climate-essentials.html#s31` jumps directly to slide 31 on load. Browser back/forward buttons now traverse slide history. Implementation: `MutationObserver` watches `.slide.active` class changes and syncs `location.hash` via `history.replaceState` (no page reload). On load + on `hashchange` event, parses the hash and calls the deck's own `showSlide()`/`show()` function (tries multiple signatures), falling back to manual class swap + progress UI update if no API matches.

### Fixed
- **Climate-essentials slide 4 overflow** — removed the redundant Pakistan floods bullet (`<li>The 2022 Pakistan floods were made 50% more likely…</li>`) that was getting clipped at the bottom now that font-shrinking is disabled. Same data point appears in slide 9's "Attribution evidence" hbox with fuller context (one-third of country underwater, 1,700 deaths, $30B damage), so no information is lost.

## [10.23.29] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **No more font shrinking on slides**. User explicitly: "I dont want to shrink fonts. I want to make sure the content is proportionately and consistently fitting." Removed `class="slide compact"` from all 51 manually-marked slides across 7 native decks (climate 6 + dev-econ 7 + inequality 5 + mel 4 + pub-finance 18 + social-margins 3 + work-labour 8). Also disabled the runtime `ensureFit` auto-compact (introduced in v10.23.22) — JS no longer adds `.compact` or `.ultra-compact` classes on overflow detection. CSS rules for `.slide.compact` and `.slide.ultra-compact` remain in the stylesheets but become inert (no slides carry the class). Slides that previously got their fonts shrunk to fit now render at base font sizes.
- **Trade-off acknowledged**: slides that genuinely have too much content for the 1280×720 viewport will now overflow visibly (clipped at the bottom) rather than auto-shrink. This makes content overflow obvious so it can be addressed editorially (split into 2 slides, trim content) rather than masked by font reduction.

### Fixed (slide structure)
- **Slide 31 climate-essentials (Carbon Budget — Stern vs Nordhaus)** — `<div class="two-col half">` was closing too early before the right column, orphaning the right-column stat-grid + hbox outside the grid container. Right column now properly nested inside two-col.
- **Slides s4 climate, s4 + s63 dev-economics** — same orphaned-right-column malformation, fixed via Python regex pattern matcher.

## [10.23.28] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Bullet-list `<strong>` no longer breaks into a separate column**. Across all 7 native decks. The `.bullet-list li` rule used `display:flex; gap:12px; align-items:flex-start` with the bullet as a `::before` pseudo-element — but inline children of a flex container become flex items themselves, so each `<strong>...</strong>` was rendering as a separate flex item alongside the trailing text node. Result: the strong got its own narrow column and the body text got a wider one, so on slide 10 of climate-essentials (Carbon Budget) "Deep decarbonisation:" wrapped to its own column while the body "Energy systems, transport..." rendered in a parallel column. User flagged this as the "deep carbonisation misalignment".
- Replaced flex layout with `position:relative` + `padding-left:19px` on `<li>` and `position:absolute; left:0; top:9px` on `::before`. The bullet dot floats outside the text flow; strong + body text now wrap together as a single inline flow. Applied to all 7 decks (each had different default bullet colors — handled). Responsive override updated from `margin-top:7px` to `top:8px` to match the larger 8px bullet on bigger screens.

## [10.23.27] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Stat-grid cards now size to their own content** — across all 7 native decks. Changed `.stat-grid { align-items: stretch }` (default) to `align-items: start`. Previously cards in a row stretched to match the tallest sibling, leaving empty space at the bottom of cards with shorter labels. Now each card is just as tall as its own content; the row no longer shows uneven empty space below shorter labels. User flagged this pattern as the broader version of the v10.23.26 stat-card alignment issue.

## [10.23.26] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Stat-card label alignment** across all 7 native decks. The v10.23.21 "alignment hardening" added `.stat-card .stat-label{flex:1 1 auto; margin-top:auto}` which pushed the label to the BOTTOM edge of equal-height stat-cards in a grid — creating an awkward gap between the stat-number and the label whenever cards stretched to match the tallest sibling. User flagged climate-essentials slide 10 (Carbon Budget) where the 380 GtCO₂ + 10 years stat-cards showed the gap most clearly. Removed the offending flex rules so stat-cards revert to natural block layout: number on top, label right below, no forced bottom-anchoring. Cards still equal-height via grid `align-items:stretch` default; extra space (when any) sits at the bottom edge of the card, not in the middle.
- Also removed two over-broad rules from v10.23.21 that forced `display:flex; flex-direction:column` on every `<div>` child of inline `display:grid` containers (caused unintended layout shifts on hand-coded grids in some slides).

### Kept
- `.two-col, .two-col.half/.a32/.a23 { align-items:start }` — top-aligns side-by-side columns when content heights differ. Genuine improvement, retained.
- `.col-panel { display:flex; flex-direction:column }` + `.col-panel-title { flex:0 0 auto }` — keeps col-panel titles at top with body flowing below. Retained.

## [10.23.25] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Social Margins 101 Phase 2 vector expansion** — 7 new deeper data + practice slides inserted into Section 12 (slides 108-114), one per vector beyond the existing primer. Section 12 now carries 17 slides total (was 10).
  - **s108 — Adivasi Land Loss & Forest Rights**: FRA 2006 implementation gap (~13% of CFR claims granted), 50%+ of all displacement is tribal, Hasdeo/Niyamgiri/Pathalgadi flashpoints, Schedule V vs VI vs PESA. Practitioner FPIC translation.
  - **s109 — Religious Minorities — Sachar to Citizenship**: Sachar 2006 (Muslims worse than SCs), Misra 2007 + Ranganath Mishra (Dalit Christian/Muslim SC eligibility pending), CAA 2019 + NRC Assam (1.9M excluded), 12-state anti-conversion laws.
  - **s110 — Gender Beyond Caste**: care economy 297 vs 31 min/day (9.6× gap, widest in G20), FLFPR 33% recovery, MMR 97/100K (Kerala 19, Assam 195), SRHR access. Counter to "gender mainstreaming" as add-on.
  - **s111 — Queer & Trans Post-NALSA**: NALSA 2014, Section 377 read-down 2018, Trans Persons Act 2019 critique vs Pakistan 2018 Act, marriage equality 2023 verdict (Supriyo Chakraborty), hijra/khwaja sira historical recognition.
  - **s112 — Disability — The 4% Reservation Reality**: Census 2.21% vs WHO 15-20% (measurement politics), 4% PwD reservation only ~1.5% filled, 27% disabled children out of school, NMHS mental health gap (150M need care, <9k psychiatrists).
  - **s113 — Linguistic Federalism**: 22 Eighth Schedule + 800 unscheduled, Three-Language Formula NEP 2020, Tamil Nadu anti-Hindi politics since 1965, language as gatekeeper for state employment + judicial access.
  - **s114 — Class as a Vector**: Top 1% wealth share 40.6% (Oxfam 2023), 36% of BPL households are SC/ST, EWS 10% reservation (Janhit Abhiyan 2022), within-caste class differentiation. Why income-only and caste-only targeting both miss what the other captures.
- Each new slide carries: structural body paragraph, 4 bullet points with citations, and a colored callout box ("practitioner translation" / "for programme design" / etc.). Templates use the existing `.two-col.half`, `.bullet-list`, `.hbox` styles.

### Changed
- **Slide IDs renumbered** in social-margins: existing s108-s114 (Section 13 + appendix charts + End slide) shifted to s115-s121. SLIDE_IDS array extended; End slide footer `slide-number` updated to 121.
- **TOC entry** for Section 12 updated from "Slides 98-107" → "Slides 98-114".
- **Section 13 entry** in Reading the deck note updated from "108-110" → "115-117".
- **Section 12 divider subtitle** rewritten to mention the 8 primers + 7 deeper slides structure.

### Result
- Social Margins 101 deck now has **121 total slides** (was 114) with substantively expanded treatment of all 7 vectors beyond caste. Phase 2 closed.

## [10.23.24] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **One more ECharts data slide per native deck** (7 new charts, total now 4 per deck), inserted just before the End slide:
  - **climate-essentials** — India's power mix 2010 vs 2024 (stacked bar). Coal still ~50% of installed capacity, but solar grew 0.2 GW → 90 GW. Source: CEA / Ministry of Power.
  - **dev-economics** — India MPI decline 2005-06 → 2019-21 (line+area). 55.1% → 16.4% headcount; 415M people exited multidimensional poverty. Source: NITI Aayog / OPHI.
  - **inequality-basics** — India consumption Gini 1983-2022 (line). Stable through 1990s; rose with liberalisation. Source: NSSO + PLFS.
  - **mel-basics** — RACI matrix heatmap (6 tasks × 5 roles, R/A/C/I codes). Programme Manager accountable; M&E officer responsible for indicator framework; Field Team responsible for data collection.
  - **public-finance-budgeting** — India fiscal deficit Centre + States + Combined 2010-2024 (multi-line). Combined deficit averaged ~6.5% pre-COVID, jumped to 13.3% in 2020-21, slow consolidation since. Source: RBI State Finances + Union Budget.
  - **social-margins** — Manual scavenging deaths in India 2013-2023 (bar). 39-117 deaths/year despite the 2013 Prohibition Act. Over 95% of victims are Dalits. Source: NCSK + Ministry of Social Justice.
  - **work-labour-livelihoods** — India labour share of GVA 1981-2022 (line+area). Fell from ~60% to ~50% — a 10pp shift from labour to capital, mirroring global middle-income trend. Source: Penn World Tables + RBI.
- End slide IDs renumbered s103 → s104 (s113 → s114 in social-margins) to make room.

### Updated (Wiki)
- **`101-Course-Decks.md`** — full rewrite reflecting the 40-course state with 7 native HTML decks + 31 Gamma + 2 coming soon. Documents native deck features (end slides, charts, runtime overflow detection, auto-spacious, table improvements, logo→landing, fullscreen pill).
- **`Changelog.md`** — condensed v10.23.13-23 summary entry covering 11 point releases.

## [10.23.23] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **axe-core SERIOUS color-contrast violation resolved** on all 12 flagship Resources & Practice cards. Eyebrow text on `.lab` (#10B981 → #047857), `.notebooklm` (#6366F1 → #4338CA), `.course101` (#0EA5E9 → #0369A1), and `.dojo` (#EF4444 → #B91C1C) cards previously failed WCAG 2.1 AA at 2.54-4.47:1 contrast on white card backgrounds. New darker variants all clear ≥5.4:1 (PASS). Same hue family preserved — only brightness reduced. Affected: SEL, dataviz, devai, devecon, gandhi, gender, law, media, mel, poa, pubchoice, pubpol.
- **axe-core image-redundant-alt warning** on `.sidebar-logo-icon > img[alt="ImpactMojo"]` resolved across 7 flagship pages (mel, devecon, law, media, poa, pubchoice, pubpol). The img sits in the same `<a class="sidebar-logo">` as a `<span class="sidebar-logo-text">ImpactMojo</span>` — the alt was redundant. Set `alt=""` so the image is treated as decorative and the link is labelled by the visible text.
- **axe-core landmark-region warnings** resolved:
  - `index.html` practitioner trust strip: `<div class="practitioner-trust-strip">` → `<aside aria-label="Practitioner trust">`. The 8 social-proof spans (Multilateral Banks, UN Agencies, Research Institutes, etc.) are now inside an aside landmark.
  - `bct-repository.html` `#compareBar`: `<div>` → `<aside role="region">`.
  - All 12 flagship topbars: added `role="navigation" aria-label="Site navigation"` to `<div class="im-topbar" id="imTopbar">`. The browse/premium/theme-selector children are now inside a navigation landmark.

### Result
- axe-core CI check that has been failing on every commit since v10.23.16 should now pass.
- pa11y-ci, Validate HTML, Check broken links, and main CI workflow continue to pass.

## [10.23.22] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Real overflow detection replaces heuristic auto-compact** across all 7 native decks. The v10.23.19 heuristic (≥11 li / ≥2 tables / >1900 chars) missed slides that genuinely overflowed but didn't hit any of those thresholds — e.g. climate-essentials slide 4 (5 bullets + 1 hbox + 1 5-row component grid: cut off at the bottom). Replaced with a runtime check that observes `scrollHeight > clientHeight` on the active slide's `.slide-content` container and applies `.compact`. If the slide still overflows after compact is applied, an `.ultra-compact` class escalates further (smaller fonts, tighter padding, denser table cells/hboxes/term-boxes/col-panels). MutationObserver re-runs the check whenever a new slide becomes active and on window resize. Net effect: any slide that doesn't fit gets auto-tightened until it does, regardless of whether the overflow comes from bullets, tables, info-boxes, term-definitions, stat-cards, or grid-based component lists.

## [10.23.21] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Pseudo-table alignment hardening** across all 7 native decks. User reported "table block" layouts where text was misaligned because the layouts use div-grids rather than `<table>` elements. Without a specific slide reference, applied structural alignment fixes to the most common pseudo-table patterns:
  - `.stat-grid` cards now use flex column with `stat-label` pushed to bottom (`margin-top:auto`) so labels align across a row even when card heights differ from variable text wrapping.
  - `.col-panel` uses flex column with title fixed at top, body flowing below.
  - `.two-col` (and variants `.half`, `.a32`, `.a23`) get `align-items:start` so content top-aligns when column heights differ.
  - Inline `display:grid` divs inside `.slide-content`: cells now use flex column for predictable internal alignment.
- Speculative fix; awaiting specific slide URL for targeted treatment of remaining cases.

## [10.23.20] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Fullscreen button no longer covers `www.impactmojo.in`** in slide-header. Added `padding-right:120px` to `.slide-header` across all 7 native decks, pushing the right-hand `header-url` text leftward so the fs-hint pill (positioned `right:18px`) sits in clear space and no longer obscures the URL text.

### Added
- **Auto-spacious mode** for sparse slides — symmetric counterpart to v10.23.19's auto-compact. JS heuristic adds `.slide.spacious` to any non-compact, non-divider slide with under 420 characters of text content (excluding chart canvases and tables). Spacious mode bumps `slide-title.sm` from 24px → 30px, `slide-body` from 15px → 17px, `bullet-list li` from 15px → 16px, and adds 18px padding on `hbox` callouts. Slides that previously looked underfilled with small fonts now read with appropriate visual weight.
- **One new ECharts data slide per native deck** (7 charts total), inserted just before the End slide:
  - **climate-essentials** — CO₂ per capita 2023 by region (horizontal bar). Africa 1.0 / India 1.9 / EU 6.4 / China 7.7 / Russia 11.4 / USA 14.4 t/cap. Source: Global Carbon Project / Our World in Data.
  - **dev-economics** — India sectoral GDP composition 1950-2023 (stacked area). Agri 51%→17%, Industry 14%→27%, Services 35%→56%. Source: World Bank / RBI.
  - **inequality-basics** — Top 1% pre-tax income share, cross-country comparison (horizontal bar). Sweden 11.7% → South Africa 21.9%, with India at 21.7%, USA 20.5%. Source: WID 2024.
  - **mel-basics** — Theory of Change as a 5-node directed graph (Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact) with arrow-labelled link types (efficiency, effectiveness, attribution, contribution).
  - **public-finance-budgeting** — Tax-to-GDP ratio cross-country bar. Bangladesh 8% / Indonesia 12% / India 17.8% → Brazil 32.5% / OECD 33.8% / Norway 39.8%. Source: World Bank / OECD / IMF.
  - **social-margins** — Multidimensional Poverty headcount by social group (India 2023). ST 21.4% / Muslims 14.4% / SC 14.0% / OBC 11.5% / National 11.3% / Hindus 11.6% / Others 7.5%. Source: NITI Aayog National MPI 2023.
  - **work-labour-livelihoods** — India female LFPR (15+) 2017-18 → 2022-23 (line with area). 17.5% → 33.0% trajectory. Source: PLFS annual rounds.
- Each new chart slide carries: section label, contextual paragraph, full-width canvas, and "what to see" amber-callout takeaway.
- End slide IDs renumbered from `s102` → `s103` (and `s112` → `s113` in social-margins) to make room.

### Fixed (drive-by)
- Typo `www.impacctmojo.in` → `www.impactmojo.in` in dev-economics deck slide-footer (one slide).

## [10.23.19] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Native deck formatting polish — fullscreen button, nav overlap, content overflow** across all 7 native decks.
  - **Fullscreen button (`#fs-hint`)**: previously rendered at 9px font with 25% white opacity — barely visible, sometimes mistaken for being clipped/cut off. Repositioned with safer margins (top:14px, right:18px), bumped font to 10px, raised contrast to 85% white, added a translucent dark pill background (with dark-mode counterpart) and 14px border-radius. Now obviously a clickable element.
  - **Bottom navigation overlap**: `#nav` fixed at `bottom:16px` was sitting visually on top of slide content because the slide-viewport scales to fill the browser window. Added a fade-on-idle behaviour (drops to 18% opacity after 2.2s of no input; full opacity on hover or any mouse/keyboard/touch activity). Also increased `.slide-content` bottom padding from 20px to 46px so content doesn't crowd into the nav strip even when nav is fully visible.
  - **Content overflow auto-compact**: added a JS heuristic that runs at load and adds the existing `.slide.compact` modifier to any slide with ≥11 `<li>` items, ≥2 `<table>`s, or >1900 characters of text. Skips title screens, section dividers, end screens, and TOC slides. Existing `.slide.compact` rules already shrink fonts and padding on dense slides; auto-application means content-heavy slides no longer overflow the 1280×720 viewport. Also tightened `.slide.compact` rules for tables (`.ctable td` 12px / 6px padding), info-boxes (`.hbox` 10px padding, 12.5px text), and bottom-padding on the content area.

### Known follow-ups (not in this PR)
- Some slides have **too little content** with small fonts on otherwise-empty slides — opposite of overflow. Needs per-slide content audit and either copy expansion or font promotion (`slide-title sm` → `lg`). Out of scope for a structural CSS fix.
- **Charts/diagrams density**: most decks currently carry only 2 ECharts data slides each (the v10.23.15 batch). User asked for more diagrams across decks — that's substantive content work (research, data sourcing, ECharts authoring per slide) and warrants its own PR.

## [10.23.18] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Native 101 deck tables — added inside borders + vertical alignment** across all 7 native decks (climate-essentials, dev-economics, inequality-basics, mel-basics, public-finance-budgeting, social-margins, work-labour-livelihoods). The `.ctable` class previously had only `border-bottom` on `<td>`, no vertical separators between columns, and no `vertical-align` rule — multi-line cells looked misaligned and columns blurred together. Added: outer 1px border, vertical right-borders on every `<th>`/`<td>` (with `:last-child` cleared), `vertical-align: top` so wrapped text in one cell doesn't drag adjacent cells with it, and `tr:last-child td { border-bottom: none }` for a clean bottom edge. Dark-mode counterparts also added. Tables now read as proper grids rather than horizontal-stripe blocks.
- **Slide-header logo links → 101 Series landing page** across every slide in all 7 native decks (724 links updated total: 102 per deck × 6 + 112 in social-margins). Previously the logo on every slide pointed to `https://www.impactmojo.in` (homepage), which made it hard to jump back to the 101 Series landing without navigating up two levels. Now the logo on every slide (including the end slide) points to `https://www.impactmojo.in/101-courses/` — the real landing page for the 101 deck context. Single click from any slide → browse all 40 101 courses.

## [10.23.17] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Browse button redesign across 118 inner pages.** The previous Browse-link styling was a flat text link with muted colour — visually weak next to the gradient Premium button. Replaced site-wide with an outline button: 1.5px border, uppercase Inter 700, 0.5rem padding, hover state that fills with the cyan accent + lifts on translateY + adds soft shadow. Dark-mode variant uses translucent white background. Result: better visual balance with the Premium button, more inviting interaction state. Affected: all flagship course pages, all 101 deck landing pages, all DeepDives pages, all BookSummary pages, all top-level pages.

## [10.23.16] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Universal "Resources & Practice" cross-link section** added to all 12 flagship course pages (SEL, dataviz, devai, devecon, gandhi, gender, law, media, mel, poa, pubchoice, pubpol). Each section carries 7 colour-coded resource cards: Hands-on Lab (course-specific or generic), NotebookLM AI Companion (with course-specific URL where available — 11 of 12 flagships have one), Foundational 101 Decks (course-specific recommendations + browse-all), BookCompanion Field Companions (course-specific + browse-all), Print-Friendly Reference Handouts, Live Dojo Practice Sessions, Premium Tools & Coaching. Closes the long-running flagship parity ask: every flagship now has a consistent baseline of cross-linked resources, regardless of how rich its main content is.
- Per-flagship customisation: dataviz cross-links the dataviz lab + storytelling/info-we-trust books; mel cross-links TOC Lab + MEL Plan Lab; gender cross-links 3 thematically-related 101 courses (SRHR, care economy, data feminism); pubchoice cross-links Political Economy + Public Finance 101 + Indian Constitution 101; etc.
- Bespoke Sargam-style SVGs replace 21 remaining body emojis (📚 📧 💬 👋 ♥ 🌐 📩 ⚠ 📏 🏆 🎓 🗓) across 7 files (`accessibility.html`, `blog.html`, `blog/sample-size-matters.html`, `blog/whats-coming-in-2026.html`, `catalog.html`, `content-marketing-kit.html`, `forgot-password.html`). Body emojis platform-wide now at zero.

## [10.23.15] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **14 substantive ECharts data slides** across all 7 native ImpactMojo-hosted 101 decks (2 per deck). Each slide carries: contextual paragraph above the chart, full-width visualisation in a bordered canvas, and a "what to see" amber-callout takeaway below. Charts use the requested fancy types (no pies):
  - **climate-essentials**: Sankey of global CO₂ emissions (energy carrier → sector, ~37 GtCO₂); area chart of NASA GISTEMP temperature anomaly 1880-2023.
  - **dev-economics**: Multi-series line panel of South Asia per-capita GDP (PPP) trajectories 1990-2023 — India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal; Sankey of India's structural transformation (workforce 1991→2011→2023, by sector).
  - **inequality-basics**: Area chart of India top-10% income share 1922-2022 (V-shape); Lorenz curve of India wealth distribution 2023 (WID).
  - **mel-basics**: Bubble panel of evaluation methods (rigour × feasibility × cost) — RCT, DiD/RDD, PSM, pre-post survey, contribution analysis, outcome harvesting, qualitative, MSC; circular graph linking indicator types (input/output/outcome/impact) to MEL methods.
  - **public-finance-budgeting**: Union Budget Sankey (tax revenue → expenditure heads, FY24); multi-country debt/GDP panel (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, China, USA, Japan).
  - **social-margins**: Identity-intersection chord (caste/tribe/religion/gender/sexuality/disability/region/class with edge-weights reflecting empirical co-incidence); SC/ST PoA Act atrocity cases bar+line panel 1995-2022 (cases + conviction rate).
  - **work-labour-livelihoods**: Stacked area of India workforce share by sector 1983-2023; Sankey of formal/informal decomposition of India's workforce (PLFS 2022-23).
- ECharts 5.5.0 added to all 7 native decks — supports sankey, chord, area, beeswarm, parallel coordinates, custom layouts.
- New `.slide.compact` modifier: tighter font/spacing for slides with 11+ list items (PFB) or 14+ li / 320+ words (others). 51 slides marked compact across the 7 decks (PFB 18, climate-essentials 6, dev-economics 7, inequality-basics 5, mel-basics 4, social-margins 3, work-labour-livelihoods 8).

### Fixed
- **Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101 slides 13-15 overflow** marked compact.
- **All 7 native deck SLIDE_IDS arrays** rebuilt to include new chart slides — total slide counts now: climate-essentials 102, dev-economics 102, inequality-basics 102, mel-basics 102, public-finance-budgeting 102, social-margins 112, work-labour-livelihoods 102. Progress text + TOTAL constants synchronised.
- All chart slide IDs renamed from temporary `sN_chart` form to plain sequential `sN` for navigation continuity.

## [10.23.14] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Social Margins 101 Section 12: The Other Vectors — A South Asian Survey** (10 net-new slides). Substantively expands the deck from 100 to 110 slides with vector-specific primers on tribal/Adivasi, religion, gender (broader), sexuality & queer/trans, disability, region & language, class, migration & statelessness, plus a closing practitioner toolkit. Each primer includes structural framing, foundational voices, key indicators, constitutional/statutory architecture, and intersectional cautions. Honest accounting: caste sections (02-11) retain their depth, but the deck now genuinely delivers on its broader name.
- **101-courses/index.html** — new landing page for the ImpactMojo 101 Series. 40 courses with native HTML / Slide Deck / Coming Soon filter chips, search, tracks, hero stats, full SEO + GA. Sitemap entry, /101 short-URL redirect.
- **Standardised end slide** across all 7 native ImpactMojo-hosted 101 decks (climate-essentials, dev-economics, inequality-basics, mel-basics, public-finance-budgeting, social-margins, work-labour-livelihoods). New `.end-screen` template with gradient background, dot pattern, glow effect, gradient bar, gradient-text "Thank You" headline, byline, 3 themed CTAs (primary gradient / secondary outline / tertiary ghost), meta footer with CC BY-NC-ND. Replaces 7 different bespoke ugly closing slides with one consistent beautiful template.

### Fixed
- **Public Finance & Budgeting 101 overflow**: 18 dense slides (11+ list items each) marked with new `.slide.compact` modifier. Reduced font-size, line-height, and padding within compact slides to fit content within the fixed 1280×720 viewport. Same compact treatment applied conservatively (14+ li or 320+ words threshold) to 30 dense slides across the other 6 native decks.
- **Stale 101.impactmojo.in references**: removed from native deck end slide CTAs; replaced with self-hosted `/101-courses/` URL throughout.
- **Slide 100 (thank-you) on Social Margins**: stale link fixed; CTAs swapped from devecon/poa/101.impactmojo.in to gender/poa/decolonize-dev which are thematically aligned with Social Margins; later replaced entirely by the new standardised end-slide template.

### Changed
- Social Margins TOC + agenda updated to reflect 110 slides + new Section 12 (slides 98-107) + renumbered Section 13 (Further Reading, Glossary, Thank You at slides 108-110). Reading-the-deck guide rewritten to describe the new structure.
- HTML balance: 1494 → 1656 open/close divs in social-margins.html (added 10 substantive slides + Section 12 divider + agenda expansion). All 7 native decks balance-checked.

## [10.23.13] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Groups 9-14 audit batch.** Closed all six remaining content-type audits (101-courses, Deep Dives, Blog, Top-level pages, Flagship course pages, NotebookLM registry). 130 files scanned across 6 groups; 86 files patched in a single commit.
- **SEO baseline 100%** across all 130 audited files: 14 canonical links + 38 og:image + 70 og:site_name + 4 full twitter:card blocks added. Default og:image is the ImpactMojo logo at `/assets/images/ImpactMojo Logo.png`. Twitter cards include matching title/description/image. Inserted after the last existing `og:` tag where present, otherwise after meta description.
- **3 native 101 decks (PFB, social-margins, work-labour-livelihoods)** received full SEO + Google Analytics installation: meta description, robots, canonical, og:type/title/description/url/image/site_name, twitter:card block, and the GA G-JRCMEB9TBW snippet. Previously they had only `<title>` + viewport because the Claude-Chat-generated slide-deck template ships with minimal head metadata.
- **54 dingbat replacements** (✓ ✗ ✦ ✧) → inline Sargam-style stroke SVGs across 14 files: `101-courses/mel-basics.html` (10 ✗/✓ marks in pros/cons lists), `blog/learning-by-doing.html` (1), `blog/theory-of-change-pitfalls.html` (5 ✓ Strong labels), `content-marketing-kit.html` (8), and 10 flagship course pages (3 sparkles each in v3-hero decoration). SVGs sized via `width:1em; height:1em` with `vertical-align:-0.15em` to inherit text colour and baseline.
- **NotebookLM registry verified clean**: 11 entries, all with title + URL, JSON valid. No drift between registry and platform claims.

### Known drift (deferred)
- 21 real-emoji chars remain across 7 files (📚📧💬👋♥🌐📩⚠📏🏆🎓🗓): used as functional UI category icons (`accessibility.html`, `forgot-password.html` chatbot menus), friendly greetings (`👋` on `blog.html`, `catalog.html`), and content emphasis (3 in `whats-coming-in-2026.html`). Need bespoke 1:1 SVG mapping per use case rather than bulk substitution. Tracked for a dedicated emoji-to-Sargam pass.

## [10.23.12] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Social Margins 101 — Phase A finish (lightweight cross-vector signposting).** Caste content in sections 02-11 retained as the deepest vector treatment in the deck; each section divider now carries an italic "Parallels" subtitle explicitly connecting the section's analytical frame to other vectors (tribe, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, region, language, class). Examples: section 04 (Colonialism & Census) parallels — Hindu/Muslim binary, Scheduled Tribes vs PVTGs, Hindi/Urdu wedge, criminalised hijra under CTA 1871; section 05 (Constitution) parallels — Schedules V/VI, Articles 25-30, NALSA, RPWD Act; section 11 (Contemporary Debates) parallels — caste census ↔ religion-based reservation, EWS ↔ poverty as vector, AI bias ↔ identity surveillance.
- Agenda note (slide 2) rewritten from "deep treatment of caste anchored by..." to a "Reading the deck" framing that names where each vector is treated and explicitly signposts the parallels mechanism.
- Added `.div-subtitle` CSS rule (italic 15px, 62%-opacity white, max-width 680px) to support cross-vector subtitles on section dividers.
- HTML balance preserved (1494 open / 1494 close divs, 100 slides). Phase A is considered complete for v10.23.x. Net-new vector sections (Tribal/Adivasi, Religion broader, Gender broader, Sexuality, Disability, Region/Language, Class) as their own slide modules are tracked for future releases under the broader Social Margins expansion.

## [10.23.11] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **Caste Studies 101 folded into expanded Social Margins 101.** User feedback: separate Caste Studies course was too narrow; Social Margins is the better umbrella name for a course covering all identity vectors (caste, tribe, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, region, language, class). Architectural switchover (`fd3c909`) shipped first; Phase A content expansion ongoing across releases.
- **Foundational course count: 41 → 40** (Caste Studies merged into expanded Social Margins). 4 native HTML decks now: social-margins, public-finance-budgeting, work-labour-livelihoods, plus 36 Gamma-hosted.
- `social-margins.html` (was the Gamma-only Marginalised Identities 101) now lives as a 100-slide native HTML deck:
  - Section 01 (slides 3-8) **fully rewritten** to be foundational across all identities — "What Are Social Margins?", "Vectors of Marginalisation", "Foundational Voices on Identity & Marginalisation" (Ambedkar, Crenshaw, Spivak, Iris Marion Young, Phule, Uma Chakravarti), "Categories That Shape Identity Analysis" (ascribed/achieved, visible/invisible, identity/structure, recognition/redistribution), "Intersectionality — How Identities Compound" (Crenshaw + South Asian translation).
  - Sections 02-11 (slides 9-97) currently retain the existing strong caste content (origins, anti-caste thought, colonialism/census, Article 17/reservations, economy, violence, education, gender×caste, diaspora, contemporary debates). Agenda transparently flags that broader sections (Tribal/Adivasi, Religion, Gender broader, Sexuality, Disability, Region, Language, Class) are "in expansion in upcoming releases".
  - Section 12 lexicon (slide 99) restructured to a 3-column table with **Vector** annotations — added Intersectionality, Subaltern, Recognition vs Redistribution, NALSA judgment, Section 377, Hijra, RPWD Act 2016, Social model of disability, Communalism, Sub-nationalism alongside existing caste terms.
- 301 redirects: `/101-courses/caste-studies` → `/101-courses/social-margins.html`.
- Catalog `c40` (Caste Studies) deleted; `c17` retitled "Marginalised Identities 101" → "Social Margins 101" with broader scope description. Filter chip 41 → 40.
- Homepage modal: Caste Studies item removed; Social Margins item swapped from Gamma fallback to direct native HTML link with new description. Heading "All Courses (53)" → 52. View-All-Courses button 53 → 52. C16 dropdown option label updated.
- `search-index.json`: `COURSE-CASTE-STUDIES` replaced by `COURSE-SOCIAL-MARGINS` with expanded tag set.
- `sitemap.xml`: caste-studies removed; social-margins lastmod 2026-04-05 → 2026-05-01, priority 0.7 → 0.8.
- 13 docs files updated to reflect 53 → 52 / 41 → 40 counts (README, catalog hero, 11 docs/*.md).

### Note
This is a **Phase B (architectural) commit + partial Phase A (content)**. The deck is correctly named, discoverable, and has rewritten foundational framing — but full deep treatment of non-caste identity vectors as their own sections is queued for upcoming releases. User explicitly authorised iterative refinement: "we can always revise A".

## [10.23.10] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Public Choice — 12th flagship course** at `/courses/pubchoice/` — *Decisions, Incentives & Institutions*. 13 modules synthesising the Virginia school (rent-seeking), Bloomington school (commons), and New Institutional Economics, with cases from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. 83-term interactive lexicon. 12th NotebookLM AI Study Companion.
- **3 new 101-courses** — native slide-deck (1280×720, 12 sections) format: *Caste Studies 101* (varna/jati, Ambedkarite thought, anti-caste movements), *Public Finance & Budgeting 101* (Union/state budgets, finance commissions, budget transparency), *Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101* (SNA boundary, care economy, sustainable-livelihoods framework, agrarian question, migration, non-farm economy).
- **Deep Dives** — new content type at `/DeepDives/`: 5 curated annotated reading lists by Sukhmeet Bedi + ImpactMojo Editorial team (Indian Political Economy, Impact Measurement, Climate & Just Transitions in South Asia, Caste/Identity/Development, Data/Power/Global South). Mixed media (books, papers, podcasts, datasets), 2–4 sentence annotations per reading.

### Changed
- **Foundational course count: 38 → 41**. *Work, Labour & Livelihoods 101* supersedes both *Decent Work for All 101* and *Livelihoods 101* (deleted with 301 redirects). Net +3.
- **Performance wins on index.html**: extracted 215 KB inline `<style>` to `/css/imx-main.css` (cacheable, parallel-loadable). Index dropped from 645 KB raw / 96 KB brotli → 431 KB / 64 KB. Repeat-visit TTFB improved from ~1.4s to **175 ms** (8× faster) via Netlify edge caching (`max-age=300, must-revalidate`). Auth scripts deferred to bottom of body.
- **Specials nav restructured** into 4 collapsible accordion subgroups (Reference Libraries, Long-form Reading, Practice & Programs, Behind the Scenes) replacing a flat 13-item dropdown.
- **Reference library proxies cleaned up** — eliminated `on-web.link` shortlinks (one was already 404'ing). PolicyDhara, DevDiscourses now served via Netlify Edge Functions proxying directly from the upstream GitHub Pages repos with injected `<base href>` for asset resolution.

### Fixed (content audit batch — Group 1–8)
- **Reference Libraries**: ImpactLex term count drift (claimed 1,200 vs actual 1,055), DevDiscourses count, FieldCases count — all aligned to source-of-truth across catalog, homepage, FAQ.
- **Search-index**: backfilled 27 BookSummary/Reference/Handout entries that were on disk but missing from `data/search-index.json`. 3 catalog descriptions corrected (Hindi-shipping mojini-guide misclaim).
- **Games**: emoji → SVG migration for climate-action and public-health games (Lucide-style, viewBox 0 0 24 24, 1.5px stroke). Stale `101.impactmojo.in` links replaced with self-hosted paths. `im-topbar` injected into all 16 games.
- **Labs**: `toc-lab` Browse button added. 2 mistyped lab catalog entries corrected.
- **Premium tools**: removed duplicate Code Converter Pro entry. Renamed *Qualitative Research Lab Pro* → *Qualitative Insights Lab Pro* (8 occurrences in source file). 4 missing tools backfilled to catalog (TOC Workbench Pro live; DevData Practice / Visualization Cookbook / DevEconomics Toolkit coming soon). Filter chip 7 → 9. Search-index entries added for all live tools.
- **BookSummaries**: 30 of 31 companions verified clean (viewport, meta, OG, GA, Amaranth, im-topbar, no emojis). Replaced **54 emoji instances** in dt-companion.html (Design Thinking) with inline Sargam-style SVGs across 24 unique characters. All 31 catalog titles confirmed to match canonical `<title>` in source files.
- **Flagship modules**: 5 catalog drifts + 3 homepage drifts in module counts. After fixes, all 12 flagships have consistent counts across catalog, homepage cards, and `id="module-N"` anchors. Specifically: Gandhi 12→13 (home), Devecon 12→13 (home), Dataviz 13→12 (catalog), DevAI 13→12 (catalog), MEL 13→14 (both), SEL 12→13 (catalog).
- **Handouts render bug** in `handouts.html`: `TRACK_MAPPING` had 5 of 6 stale folder-name keys (`Data Analysis Track`, `Gender Studies Track`, `Research Methods Track`, etc.) that didn't match disk. Only Policy & Economics rendered with proper colour/order — the other 5 tracks fell into "Other Resources" alphabetical fallback. Fixed all 5 + added 4 missing mappings (Education and Pedagogy, Thematic Areas, Cross Cutting Resources, Quick Reference Cards).
- **Handouts emoji removal**: replaced **1,317 emoji instances** across 63 handout files (144 unique characters) with inline Sargam-style SVGs. Self-contained (no sprite/CDN dependency) so handouts stay print-portable.
- **Typo fix**: `Handouts/Thematic Areas/South Aisa Region/` → `South Asia Region/`.
- **Count corrections**: catalog + README "400+ handouts" was inflated marketing copy → 85 actual.
- **README + 18 docs files**: backfilled all stale counts (11→12 flagships, 38→41 foundational, 48→53 courses, 400+→85 handouts, 11→12 NotebookLM).
- **Mobile**: sitewide ≤768px padding floor on top-level sections so cards stop bleeding into viewport edge.
- **Specials nav**: all 13 items now use absolute URLs (`/#flagship-courses` etc.). `js/router.js` now respects hash fragments before path-based routes.
- **DevEcon CSS shim**: defined missing `--indigo`, `--cyan`, `--orange`, `--success` aliases in all 4 `:root` blocks of `courses/devecon/index.html` (17 components were referencing undefined vars).
- **Catalog accessibility**: `.track-filter.active` failed WCAG AA contrast (sky-500 on sky-500@20%). Fixed to amber-700 light / sky-300 dark.
- **`faq-bank.js` line 167**: stray `""` syntax error was killing the whole file's parsing — fixed.

## [10.20.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Book Summary: *Beyond Developmentality* — Debal Deb** (Earthscan, 2009). Deb's eco-socialist critique of the doctrine of development: eight neo-classical myths, "developmentality" as Foucauldian epistemic apparatus, inclusive freedom, strong sustainability grounded in the Basudha farm counter-evidence. 9 chapters + 4 learning pathways + 8 key concepts + 6 South Asia lenses. BookSummaries total: 31 → 32 (with interactive archive).
- **Archived interactive companion** at `/BookSummaries/beyond-developmentality-deb-interactive.html` (original React SPA preserved), linked from the new templated page via "Launch interactive companion".
- Landing card, search-index entry, sitemap entry for the new book.

### Changed
- **Brand refresh across all 31 book summaries.** Every BookSummary now passes the 14-item ImpactMojo brand checklist:
  - Floating paper plane SVG (decorative, 30 files gained it)
  - Skip-to-content link for WCAG 2.4.1 (30 files)
  - `translate.js` defer script (30 files)
  - Favicon + apple-touch-icon (28 files)
  - Full `im-topbar` with logo + Premium CTA + 3-mode theme selector (19 files)
  - Single-file fixes: theme selector for `handbook-social-protection.html`

### Fixed
- Book counters in `BookSummaries/index.html`: total 30 → 31, dev-econ filter 6 → 7.

## [10.19.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **3 new Book Summaries** (28 → 31 total):
  - *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises* — Ray Dalio (2018)
  - *Handbook for IPCC Authors: Climate Communications* — Corner, Shaw & Clarke (2018)
  - *Storytelling to Accelerate Climate Solutions* — Coren & Wang (Springer, 2024)
- BookSummaries index cards, search index entries, sitemap URLs, docs updates

## [10.18.0] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Sitemap coverage** — 87 missing URLs added to `sitemap.xml` (2 courses, 35 foundational, 23 BookSummaries, 18 blog posts, 9 public pages). Total: 84 → 171.
- **Stale 101.impactmojo.in links** — ~100 legacy subdomain refs migrated to local paths in `js/faq-bank.js`, `js/bookmarks-compare.js`, `js/learning-tracks.js`, `js/game-agents.js`, and 4 docs files.
- **Search index phantom labs** — 6 duplicate/phantom lab entries removed, 3 missing labs added. Lab count: 17 → 13.
- **Content count drifts** — `docs/content-guide.md` (flagship 9→11, labs 19→11), `premium.html`, `catalog.html` JS comments corrected.
- **21 `.DS_Store` files** removed from git tracking.

## [10.17.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Netlify Forms migration** — 12 forms migrated from Formspree (`xpwdvgzp`) to Netlify Forms with `data-netlify="true"`, `netlify-honeypot="bot-field"`, and unique `name` attributes. Email notifications configured for all forms via Netlify hooks API.
- **Engagement drip pipeline** — 5-stage email sequence (Day 0/3/7/14/21) in `send-notification` Edge Function with deduplication via `notifications.metadata.drip_stage`. Day 21 pitches Premium for explorer-tier users with one-time support fallback.
- **Streak tracking** — `update_streak()` PL/pgSQL function increments `profiles.streak_days` on daily login, resets on miss. Called from `auth.js:fetchProfile()` as fire-and-forget RPC.
- **Post-certificate upsell** — `issue-certificate` Edge Function now sends branded congratulations email with certificate number, verification link, and subtle Premium mention for explorer-tier users.
- **Monthly newsletter** — `netlify/functions/monthly-newsletter.mjs` scheduled function (15th, 10:00 IST) parses `docs/changelog.md` for recent additions, pulls content counts from `search-index.json`, sends via `monthly-update` endpoint.
- **Premium sales letter** — `/premium-letter.html` (15KB, standalone, dark mode, mobile responsive). Conversational tone with concrete tool examples and honest pricing rationale.
- **Practitioner Starter Kit** — `/starter-kit.html` with 10 curated handouts across M&E, data, policy, and cross-cutting tracks.
- **Branded email template** — `wrapEmail()` rewritten with navy gradient header, stacked logo, blue title bar, amber-to-red accent bar, dark footer with preference management link.
- **Resend integration** — `RESEND_API_KEY` configured in Supabase secrets. Domain `impactmojo.in` verified with DKIM, SPF, DMARC DNS records added via Netlify DNS API.
- **Notifications tables** — `notifications` and `notification_preferences` tables applied to production Supabase (were defined in migration but never run). RLS policies, indexes, `notify_user()` function, auto-preference trigger, backfill for 14 existing users.
- **Daily engagement cron** — `netlify/functions/daily-engagement.mjs` (02:30 UTC / 08:00 IST) runs engagement-drip, streak-reminders, cohort-deadlines in parallel.
- **Netlify env vars** — `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set for scheduled functions.

### Changed
- **Netlify form detection** — `processing_settings.ignore_html_forms` changed from `true` to `false` via Netlify API.
- **Documentation** — CLAUDE.md, 4 rules files, 2 agent definitions, 3 command files, 2 skill files updated to reference Netlify Forms instead of Formspree.
- **`auth.js`** — added `supabaseClient.rpc('update_streak')` call after successful profile fetch.

### Removed
- **Formspree dependency** — all references to `https://formspree.io/f/xpwdvgzp` removed from production HTML/JS files. Backups retain historical references.

## [10.14.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Device-mode default theme resolution** on 70 pages — `:root` now carries light tokens, `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root {} }` drives dark, and explicit `body.{light,dark}-mode` + `[data-theme="*"]` overrides keep the theme toggle dominant. Applied to blog posts, Labs, course index + lexicon pages, admin pages, book companion tools, premium tools, `transparency`, `testimonials`, `challenges`, `bct-repository`, `dataverse`, `toc-builder`, `toc-workbench`.
- **Link-in-text-block underline rule** (WCAG 2.1 AA §1.4.1) on 74 content pages — inline `<a>` inside `<main> p` / `<main> li` now carries `text-decoration: underline`, scoped to exclude button-styled anchors.
- **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 attribution** backfilled into 17 handouts — all 84 handout pages now uniform on every brand-default check.
- **Premium topbar link** added to 11 main-site pages whose only Premium button lived inside the removed duplicate `im-topbar`.
- **Language translation widget** (`js/translate.js`) on `climate-trace-india.html` and `transparency.html`.
- **`id="home"` anchor** on `index.html` hero section so `<a href="#home">` nav links resolve (fixes pa11y NoSuchID).
- **Paper plane SVG** on `courses/gender/lexicon.html` and `courses/pubpol/lexicon.html`.
- **`<footer>` landmark** with ImpactMojo attribution on `courses/pubpol/lexicon.html`.
- **PR-comment permissions** — `accessibility.yml` + `ci.yml` now grant `pull-requests: write` (scoped per job) so `marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v3` stops failing.

### Changed
- **WCAG AA muted-text contrast** bumped across 115 files mode-aware: light `--text-muted #94A3B8→#52627A` (2.56:1→6.20:1), dark `--text-muted #64748B→#94A3B8` (3.75:1→6.96:1), dark `--text-secondary #94A3B8→#CBD5E1` (6.96:1→12.02:1).
- **`catalog.html` card colours** — scoped overrides for `.card-rating` (amber `#F59E0B`→`#B45309`/`#FBBF24`) and `.card-track` (sky `#0EA5E9`→`#0369A1`/`#38BDF8`), both now pass WCAG AA.
- **Theme system unified** on `im-theme` localStorage key — `js/cookie-ui.js`, `js/account.js`, `js/game-shell.js` all read canonical first then fall back to legacy keys (`theme`, `impactmojo-theme`, `imx_theme`) for seamless migration; all writes mirrored to legacy keys. Also set `data-theme` on `<html>`.
- **Brand fonts** — `BookSummaries/ultralearning-companion.html` (was Source Serif 4) and `BookSummaries/deep-work-companion.html` (was Merriweather) migrated to Inter / Amaranth / JetBrains Mono.
- **Content counts** aligned to ground truth across 26 files (11 flagship, 38 foundational, 11 Labs, 16 Games): `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, catalog, index, premium, upgrade, content-marketing-kit, org-dashboard, verify-certificate, updates, PressKit, blog post, and 13 `docs/*.md` files.
- **39 pictographic emoji → Sargam line icons** across 10 content pages. Typographic symbols (✓ ✔ ✦ ✧ ⚠) left as decorative characters.
- **10 unbuilt course cards** in `catalog.html` + `catalog_data.json` marked `comingSoon: true`, rendered as disabled cards with dashed border and amber "Coming Soon" pill badge: Survey Design 101, Gender Mainstreaming 101, Mixed Methods 101, Impact Evaluation 101, Maternal Health 101, Child Development 101, Feminist Research 101, Economics 101, VaniScribe (×2).

### Fixed
- **Handout 404s** — `getHandoutURL` in `handouts.html` now serves from same-origin `/Handouts/` with URL-encoded path segments (was pointing at a stale `varnasr.github.io/ImpactMojo/` mirror).
- **Duplicate `im-topbar` covering main site nav** on 28 pages — the overlay was hiding the legacy `<header class="header">` main navigation (including all dropdowns). Removed from pages where the legacy header is the real main nav; kept on handouts, blog posts, lexicons, games, and slide decks where it's the only topbar.
- **121 of 131 stale `101.impactmojo.in` links** rewritten to self-hosted equivalents via a Python migration with filesystem existence checks.

### Removed
- **PhD-level rigor marketing language** — reverted to actual tagline.

## [10.13.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Native 101 slide decks** — Replaced Gamma.app iframe wrappers with self-hosted HTML slide decks for 3 foundational courses: Development Economics 101, MEL 101, Climate Essentials 101
- **Shared deck template** — Reusable CSS (`101-courses/native/shared/deck.css`) and JS engine (`deck.js`) for all native 101 decks: light/dark/system theme, keyboard/touch/swipe nav, fullscreen, Chart.js integration, viewport scaling
- **17 Chart.js visualisations** in Dev Econ 101 (poverty trends, Lorenz curve, convergence trajectories, structural transformation, India GDP growth, rural credit, HCI comparison, UPI growth, global trade, FDI, RCT publications, caste income, urbanisation, SDG progress, jobless growth)

### Changed
- **101 deck CSS** — Proportionally larger fonts, padding, and gaps across all slide components to fill 1280×720 viewport: titles 32px/26px, body 16px, bullets 16px, stat numbers 36px, quotes 20px, charts 230px height
- **Inline style overrides** — Bumped 200+ hardcoded inline font sizes (11→13px, 12→14px, 13→15px) that CSS classes couldn't override
- **Dev Econ CTA** — "Explore the Full Course" → "Explore the Flagship Course"

### Fixed
- **Slide navigation** — Slides 51–100 were outside `slide-viewport` div in all Claude Chat-generated decks, making them unreachable by nav JS
- **JS syntax error** — Literal newlines inside Chart.js label strings broke entire script block
- **`chartsInit` declaration order** — Variable referenced before declaration in Dev Econ deck

## [10.12.0] - 2026-03-31

- **Sister repo links** — README and blog references to ImpactLex, PolicyDhara, dev-case-studies, etc. updated to org
- **`_redirects`** — Removed GitBook proxy, added Docsify SPA fallback; updated `varnasr.github.io` → `impactmojo.github.io`

### Removed
- **GitBook dependency** — No longer proxying to `impactmojo.gitbook.io`; all docs self-hosted

## [10.11.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Blog: Introducing the ImpactMojo MCP Server** — New blog post at `/blog/impactmojo-mcp-server.html` with 2 napkin.ai-generated illustrations, added card to `blog.html`

## [10.8.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **BookSummaries landing page** — `/BookSummaries/index.html` so navigation goes to a browsable landing page instead of directly to the Hanna book

### Fixed

- **Database migration** — `cohorts`, `cohort_members`, `cohort_discussions`, `notifications`, `notification_preferences` tables with full RLS policies, indexes, and triggers

### Changed
- **Auth session recovery** — Faster safety-net (1.5s + 4s fallback), increased SIGNED_OUT debounce to 1000ms, aggressive `_recoverSessionFromStorage()` for stored sessions, window.load recovery
- **API token documentation** — Added Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Sarvan.ai, Gamma to CLAUDE.md and .env.example

### Fixed
- **Gender equity game** — SVG viewBox too short, causing Madhubani art heads to be clipped
- **Info asymmetry game** — Pattachitra frame and end-story-art missing `width:100%`, appearing too small on mobile
- **Login persistence** — Session not surviving page navigation due to timing gaps in token refresh cycle

## [10.7.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **BookSummaries** — New content type under Specials: interactive book summaries

- **Profile fetch timeout** increased from 5s to 8s to reduce cache fallback on slow connections
- **Profile fetch retry** — failed fetches now auto-retry after 5 seconds so stale cached tier doesn't persist

### Added
- **Admin tier protection trigger** (`protect_admin_tier`) — database trigger prevents client-side downgrades of admin role, subscription tier, or subscription status
- **Idempotent profile creation** — `handle_new_user()` trigger now uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent overwriting existing profiles on re-authentication

## [10.5.0] - 2026-03-19

- **RQ Builder Pro** premium card — Practitioner tier, guided research question builder with PICO/SPIDER framing
- **TOC Workbench Pro** premium card — Practitioner tier, advanced Theory of Change building with assumption mapping and PDF/PNG export
- Both new tools added to premium modal, mobile-index.html, and search index

### Changed
- **Renamed "Economics Games" → "Games"** across 14 files (now covers broader topics)
- **Fixed card text contrast** across 8 games — increased badge opacity, darkened text, added text-shadows (WCAG AA)
- **Fixed Dojos nav icon** — was duplicating Flagship Courses icon, now uses Activity icon
- **Fixed PolicyDhara workflow** — commit-msg prefix mismatch causing all scheduled runs to fail

### Removed

## [10.1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Git best-practice standards** propagated across all 29 ImpactMojo repos: `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/commit-msg`, `.gitmessage`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report, feature request, content issue)

### Fixed

- **Dashboard tabs** now accept profile parameter directly, fixing race condition where tabs showed wrong role/tier

### Fixed
- **Auth gate race condition**: `authStateChanged` event fired before profile fetch completed, causing premature access denial. Both `admin-gate.js` and `auth-gate.js` now await `fetchProfile()` before checking roles
- **Dashboard tabs wrong role**: `DashboardTabs.init()` relied on global `ImpactMojoAuth.profile` which wasn't set yet. Fixed by passing profile from auth callback
- **Mobile hamburger cutting off logo**: hidden desktop-only elements (theme selector, tour toggle, starburst badge, nav buttons) on mobile across `index.html`, `account.html`, `org-dashboard.html`, `mobile-index.html`
- **Mobile logo truncation**: removed `overflow:hidden` + `text-overflow:ellipsis` that was truncating "ImpactMojo" to "Impact..." on mobile-index.html
