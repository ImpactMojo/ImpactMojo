   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: Practical and Strategic Gender Needs
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The distinction is Caroline Moser's, from "Gender Planning in the Third World:
   Meeting Practical and Strategic Gender Needs" (World Development 17(11), 1989)
   and developed in "Gender Planning and Development" (1993). Moser built it on
   Maxine Molyneux's earlier separation of women's practical and strategic
   interests, drawn from the Nicaraguan revolution ("Mobilisation Without
   Emancipation?", Feminist Studies 11(2), 1985). Molyneux is credited on the
   page; the pairing is often attributed to Moser alone.

   Practical gender needs arise from the roles women already occupy. Meeting them
   makes those roles less punishing and does not question them: a closer water
   source, a gas connection, a toilet.

   Strategic gender interests arise from women's subordinate position. Meeting
   them changes the division of labour, of assets, or of authority: a title deed,
   a seat, a law that is enforced.

   Moser's own argument is that the two are not ranked. A programme that meets
   only strategic interests while a woman walks four kilometres for water has not
   understood the day. A programme that only ever meets practical needs leaves
   the arrangement that produced them intact, and often deepens it, because it
   makes the existing division of labour work slightly better.

   ImpactMojo adds the Indian evidence.

   THE PLOT. Each case sits at two coordinates:

     relief  — how much material burden it takes off a woman's day, as observed
               rather than as intended
     shift   — how far it moves the division of labour, assets or authority

   Both are scored 0-100 by the editorial team from the evidence attached to the
   case, and both are arguable. That is the point of showing the evidence under
   each one rather than only the position. Where a case sits high on one axis and
   low on the other, the reading is the interesting part.

   Every figure is from a named source with a year.
