   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The framework is DFID's, set out in the Sustainable Livelihoods Guidance
   Sheets (1999). It formalised an argument made by Robert Chambers and Gordon
   Conway in "Sustainable Rural Livelihoods: Practical Concepts for the 21st
   Century" (IDS Discussion Paper 296, 1992), and given its analytical shape by
   Ian Scoones in "Sustainable Rural Livelihoods: A Framework for Analysis"
   (IDS Working Paper 72, 1998).

   Its central move is to stop asking what a household earns and start asking
   what it holds. Five capitals — human, social, natural, physical, financial —
   are drawn as a pentagon whose shape changes from household to household. A
   livelihood is what someone can construct out of that shape, inside a
   vulnerability context they do not control, and through structures and
   processes that decide what each asset is actually worth.

   ImpactMojo adds the Indian evidence.

   THE SHAPE IS THE POINT. Two households with the same income can hold
   completely different pentagons, and will survive completely different shocks.
   The framework's practical use is that it makes the missing corner visible.

   Scores are 0-100, assigned by the editorial team from the evidence attached
   to each case. They are comparative rather than absolute, and they are
   arguable — which is why the evidence sits under each one.

   Every figure is from a named source with a year.
