   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: the Indian Wheel of Power & Powerlessness
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dataset for /fundamentals/wheel.html

   The wheel itself is NOT ImpactMojo's. It is the Indian Wheel of Power &
   Powerlessness, built in 2022-23 by The Listeners Collective (Bengaluru) —
   Disha Paul, Ayush Biswas, Trupti M. and Ganga Nair, with contributors —
   adapting Sylvia Duckworth's Wheel of Power/Privilege, itself made for the
   Canadian Council for Refugees. See the credits section of the page.

   What ImpactMojo adds here is the evidence layer: for each of the 36 segments,
   the Indian statistics, laws and judgments that bear on where that group sits,
   plus an honest note on what the evidence does NOT settle.

   Every `evidence` entry must carry a named source and a year. If we could not
   source it, it is not in here — and where an axis has thin official data, the
   `complication` field says so rather than inventing precision.
