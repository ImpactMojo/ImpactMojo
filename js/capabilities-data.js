   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: the Capability Approach
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The approach is Amartya Sen's, developed across "Equality of What?" (1979),
   "Commodities and Capabilities" (1985) and "Development as Freedom" (1999).
   The list of ten central capabilities is Martha Nussbaum's, from "Women and
   Human Development" (2000) and restated in "Creating Capabilities" (2011).
   Sen has consistently declined to endorse a fixed list; that disagreement is
   recorded on the page rather than smoothed over.

   ImpactMojo adds the Indian evidence.

   The shape of the page is the conversion chain, because that is where the
   argument actually lives: a resource is not a freedom, and the distance
   between them is filled by conversion factors that differ by person, by
   society and by place. Every figure below is from a named source with a year.
