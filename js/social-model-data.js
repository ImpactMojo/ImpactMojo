   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: The Social Model of Disability
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The distinction between impairment and disability is the Union of the
   Physically Impaired Against Segregation's, from the "Fundamental Principles
   of Disability" (UPIAS, 1976): impairment is a condition of the body;
   disability is the disadvantage imposed on top of it by a society organised
   for people without that condition. Michael Oliver named it the social model
   in "Social Work with Disabled People" (1983) and developed it in "The
   Politics of Disablement" (1990). Vic Finkelstein and Colin Barnes carried
   the argument in Britain; Anita Ghai has made the Indian case, including
   where the model translates badly.

   The claim is narrow and precise, and it is often overstated. It is NOT that
   impairment is unreal, or that pain and illness are socially produced. It is
   that the gap between an impairment and an excluded life is filled by
   arrangements — buildings, timetables, forms, assumptions — and that those
   arrangements were chosen and can be chosen differently.

   ImpactMojo adds the Indian evidence.

   THE SHAPE OF THE PAGE. Each life outcome is drawn as a stack of barriers
   standing between a person and that outcome. The stack is the argument: the
   medical model looks at the figure at the bottom and proposes to change the
   person; the social model looks at the same figure and asks which layer of
   the stack could be removed.

   Barrier weights are 0-100, assigned by the editorial team from the evidence
   attached to each layer. They are comparative and arguable.

   Every figure is from a named source with a year.
