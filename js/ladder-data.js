   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: the Ladder of Citizen Participation
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The ladder is Sherry R. Arnstein's, from "A Ladder of Citizen Participation",
   Journal of the American Institute of Planners 35(4), July 1969. The eight
   rungs and the three bands are hers. What ImpactMojo adds is an Indian
   evidence layer: for each rung, the law, scheme or judgment that puts a real
   Indian practice on it, with the source and year named.

   Same rule as the wheel: every entry carries a named source and a year, and
   where the placement rests on a pattern rather than a statistic, the entry
   says so instead of inventing precision.

        { stat: "2013", detail: "The Supreme Court held that the gram sabhas of Niyamgiri, not the state government, would decide whether bauxite mining could proceed on their hills. Twelve village assemblies were convened and all twelve refused. The environment ministry cancelled the clearance in January 2014.", source: "Orissa Mining Corporation v. Ministry of Environment & Forests", year: "2013" },
        { stat: "§3(1)(i)", detail: "The Forest Rights Act gives the gram sabha the right to protect, regenerate and manage community forest resources. It is the strongest transfer of control to a village assembly anywhere in Indian statute.", source: "Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act", year: "2006" },

      ],
      complication: "The law here runs well ahead of the practice. Rights and Resources Initiative assessed in 2015 that forest-dwelling communities hold legal title to under 5% of the land they customarily use, and states had rejected an average of 54% of the claims decided since 2008. Niyamgiri was also narrower than it looks: the state picked 12 villages to vote, out of 112 in the affected area."

      evidence: [

India has more elected women in local government than any other country.", source: "Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act; Ministry of Panchayati Raj", year: "1992 onward" }
      ],
      complication: "Devolution is a state subject, so the rung a panchayat stands on varies by state. Most devolved functions without the funds or the staff to discharge them, leaving an elected body with authority on paper and a budget it does not control. Kerala gets cited constantly because few states went as far."

      ],
      complication: "JFM committees are created by executive circular rather than statute, and the forest department can wind one up. A partnership that one side can dissolve sits below rung 8 for that reason, and it is why the Forest Rights Act was argued for as a statutory replacement."

      n: 5, id: "placation", name: "Placation", band: "token", color: "#b45309",
      arnstein: "A few hand-picked citizens are placed on a board where they can be outvoted, which lets the powerholders say the community was represented.",

      ],
      complication: "On an organisation chart this rung looks the same as partnership, which makes it hard to spot from outside. Arnstein's test: count who can be outvoted, then check whether the body's output binds anyone."

      ],
      complication: "Arnstein placed informing on the tokenism band, which fits one-way disclosure. India's version sits awkwardly there: MGNREGA's social audit gives the information a return channel, and disclosure with a forum to contest it behaves more like the rungs above."

      ],
      complication: "Critics reach for this rung too readily. Behaviour does matter for some outcomes, and calling every demand-side programme therapy is lazy. Arnstein's distinction was whether the citizen is engaged as a person with a grievance or as a problem to be treated."
