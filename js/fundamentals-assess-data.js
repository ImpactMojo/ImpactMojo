   ImpactMojo — Fundamentals: deriving a wheel position from questions
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Why this exists
   ---------------
   The wheel originally asked people to mark where they sat. Self-placement
   measures self-perception, and self-perception is itself patterned by power:
   people near the centre routinely place themselves further out. So the error
   was not random — it ran in the direction that mattered most.

   These questions ask about group membership as a matter of fact, and then
   apply the wheel's OWN published band definitions to the answer. That is the
   whole of what happens. The result is not a measurement of anyone's life; it
   is the wheel's classification, shown back with the definition it used, so a
   person can see the reasoning and disagree with it.

   Design rules this file follows
   ------------------------------
   1. Every question is answerable as a fact, not a judgment. No question asks
      how excluded someone feels.
   2. Every question can be skipped, and skipping is offered as a first-class
      answer rather than buried. Caste, sexual orientation, religion and
      disability are all here; nobody should have to declare any of them.
   3. Every option carries the plain group name from the wheel's own data, never
      "closer to power" or "pushed to the margin" — the band is revealed after,
      with its definition, not embedded in the question.
   4. Nothing is scored, summed or ranked. A wheel is not a league table.
   5. Answers never leave the browser. There is no endpoint, and the storage key
      is the same one the manual marks already used.

   The suggestion to derive placement from questions rather than self-marking
   came from Pallavi, who also proposed the material axes on the outer band.
