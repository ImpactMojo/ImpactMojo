"""Stamp local CSS/JS references with a content hash, so fresh HTML can never
pair with a stale cached asset.

Why this exists
---------------
service-worker.js serves HTML network-first and static assets
stale-while-revalidate. That is deliberate and good for offline, but it means
the first load after a deploy can pair *fresh* HTML with the *previous*
deploy's JS. On 2026-08-19 that shipped a Fundamentals page whose HTML had a
<svg id="cubeSvg"> and whose cached JS had no code to draw into it: an empty
box on the user's phone, with no error anywhere.

Appending ?v=<hash of the file> makes the URL change whenever the file does, so
new HTML always requests a URL that cannot already be in the cache.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/stamp-assets.py            # rewrite stamps in place
    python3 scripts/stamp-assets.py --check    # exit 1 if any stamp is stale
