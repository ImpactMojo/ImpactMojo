"""Build the UpSet intersection data for The Long View, from NFHS districts.

An UpSet plot answers a question a bar chart cannot: not "how common is each
deprivation" but "which ones land on the same district". Six separate bars
reading 63%, 90%, 50%, 8%, 75%, 46% let a reader assume those are six different
sets of places. They are very largely the same places, and that is the whole
point of measuring poverty multidimensionally.

Two views are built:

  deprivation  NFHS-5 only. A district is "in" a set when it crosses a stated
               threshold on that dimension. Which combinations co-occur?
  backwards    NFHS-4 -> NFHS-5. A district is "in" a set when it moved the
               wrong way on that dimension. Which reversals travel together?

# Every other chart in The Long View carries its numbers inline, and these two

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the guard
#
# In this file each indicator is a two-element list. It is [NFHS-5, NFHS-4] --
# the LATER round first -- which is the reverse of the reading order of the
# name "NFHS-4 & NFHS-5" and the reverse of what anyone writing this script
# will assume. nfhs.html:631 is the authority: `{n5: p[0], n4: p[1]}`.
#
# Getting it backwards does not raise, does not produce nulls, and does not
# look wrong: every number stays inside its plausible range. It silently
# reports the 2015-16 survey as the 2019-21 one. On the first draft of this
# script it put district sanitation deprivation at 55% when the NFHS-5 figure
# is 7.9%, and turned a decade of near-universal sanitation gains into
# "went backwards in 96% of districts".
#
# So the order is asserted, not assumed -- but on the right property. The first
# version of this guard compared the median district value against the published
# all-India value and picked the nearer round. That is not the same statistic:
# the national figure is population-weighted, the median district is not, and for
# an indicator that splits on urban/rural the gap between them can be larger than
# the gap between the two rounds. Clean cooking fuel is exactly that case -- a
# median district of 50.5 against a national 58.6 -- so the guard failed on
# correctly-ordered data.
#
# What actually separates the two hypotheses is the DIRECTION each district
# moved. Every indicator below has a large, undisputed direction of travel
# between the rounds, and reversing the pair flips all of them at once, so
# unanimous agreement is conclusive. It is also a paired comparison -- each
# district against itself -- so the weighting problem cannot arise.
