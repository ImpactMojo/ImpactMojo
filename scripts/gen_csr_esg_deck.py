"""CSR & ESG 101 - Indian statutory CSR first, then sustainability reporting.

India-first by design: Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013 and Schedule VII
are the part that legally binds an Indian company, so they come before GRI or
TCFD. The global frameworks arrive late, as context for BRSR.

Legal thresholds and dates change. Every claim that could go stale carries its
source on the slide, and section 11 tells the learner to check the current
position at mca.gov.in and sebi.gov.in rather than trusting a deck.
