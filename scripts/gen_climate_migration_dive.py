Its chapters on Asia and on poverty and livelihoods set out how heat, floods, cyclones, sea-level rise, and erratic monsoons are reshaping where people can live and work — and conclude that displacement and migration are already among climate change's clearest human consequences.

Crucially, it shows the numbers fall sharply with early action on emissions and development — the projection is a warning, not a fate."},

The paper that retired the simple \"climate refugee\" narrative."},

A vital corrective to the assumption that climate impacts produce mass exodus — sometimes they produce immobility."},

Bangladesh's low-lying delta faces sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion ruining farmland, and relentless riverbank erosion — and much of the resulting movement flows into the megacity of Dhaka, already among the fastest-growing on earth. The clearest illustration of climate stress translating into rural-to-urban migration."},

A useful bridge from diagnosis to the policy agenda."},

        "South Asia sits at the sharp end of two global forces at once: it is among the regions most exposed to climate change, and it is home to some of the largest and most mobile populations on earth. Sea-level rise eats at the Bengal delta; saltwater creeps into Bangladeshi farmland; cyclones batter the eastern Indian coast; heatwaves and failing monsoons stress the drylands. Where these pressures meet poverty and dense settlement, people move — and the question of how climate reshapes human movement here is one of the defining development questions of the century.",
        "The first thing the evidence does is complicate the headlines. There is no such thing, in law, as a \"climate refugee,\" and the image of millions fleeing rising seas in a single wave is misleading. Environmental change rarely drives migration on its own; it works through economic, social, and political channels, and migration is often a deliberate <em>adaptation</em> — a way to spread risk and send money home — rather than simply a tragedy. Just as important is the opposite finding: the poorest are frequently <em>trapped</em>, unable to afford to leave the most dangerous places. Most climate-related movement, too, is internal — within countries, often from countryside to city — not across borders.",
        "And it is, finally, a justice question. The people displaced by climate change have done the least to cause it, which is why displacement now sits inside the global fight over Loss and Damage and who should pay for climate harm. This list moves from the science and the numbers, through the conceptual framing, into South Asia's specific geographies, and out to protection and policy. Start with the IPCC and Groundswell for scale, then Black's <em>Nature</em> paper and the Foresight report for how to think about it clearly.",
