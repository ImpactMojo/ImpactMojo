"""Join the prison and court tables into one clean table for justice.html.

The same trap the CSR data set: every NCRB table carries THREE total rows --
'Total (States)', 'Total (UTs)' and 'Total (All India)' -- so summing a column
returns exactly three times the real figure. 1,590,999 prisoners instead of
530,333. The court tables carry one 'Total' row and double instead.

Nothing about that is visible in the output: the file is valid, the page
renders, and every number on it is wrong by a clean multiple. So the totals are
read from the Total row, the parts are summed separately, and the two are
required to agree before anything is written.

Population and SC/ST shares are Census 2011, the most recent enumerated count
India has. Prison figures are a single-day census as on 31-12-2024, so a
per-100,000 rate is 2024 prisoners over 2011 people, and the page says so.
Court pendency is from the National Judicial Data Grid as on 9 March 2026, as
given to the Lok Sabha; scripts/fetch-justice-data.py records every source.
