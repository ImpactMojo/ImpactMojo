"""
Supabase anon-exposure guard.

Replaces the daily "Supabase health" Claude routine with something that lives in
the repo and runs in CI. It re-probes, with the *public* anon key, the exact
contract established by the 2026-08-03 remediation (PR #895):

  - the four tables that once had a blanket anon GRANT must stay anon-denied
  - the deliberately public reads must keep working, so an over-correction that
    breaks certificate verification or the public profile fields is caught too
  - the sensitive profile columns must stay denied

No secrets. The URL and anon key are read from js/config.js, which is the same
pair every browser already receives, so this file never duplicates them and can
never drift from what the site actually ships.

Exit 0 = contract holds. Exit 1 = a probe returned something other than the
contract (either a regression, or a change that needs this file updated).

# The table probes above miss the whole RPC surface, which is where the
# 2026-08-19 review found the real exposure: notify_user was anon-executable
# with an arbitrary p_user_id plus free-text title, body and link, and
# update_streak with an arbitrary p_user_id. Both were reachable because
# Postgres grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC by default and nothing had revoked it.
#
# Probing sends a no-argument body, so a function that takes arguments cannot
# actually run -- this checks visibility, never behaviour. PostgREST answers:
#   200 -> executable (and it ran)
#   401 -> the role has no EXECUTE
#   404 -> not in this role's schema cache, or no matching signature
# After the revoke, the denied functions drop out of anon's schema cache and
# answer 404, which is what these expect.
