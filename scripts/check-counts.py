"""Content-count drift guard — sitewide.

Canonical counts live in data/counts.json (single source of truth). This
script scans every CURRENT-CLAIM, user-facing surface and fails if any
"<number> <content type>" phrase disagrees with the canonical value.

Coverage (the point of the 2026-08 rewrite — no more per-file exceptions
for the live site):
  * ALL root-level *.html — the website's landing / marketing / legal /
    premium pages — are scanned automatically. New pages are covered the
    moment they're added; nobody has to remember to add them here.
  * The present-tense GitBook overview docs + README.
  * The Dataverse total is now tracked (key "dataverse") in all its prose
    and tile phrasings.

Deliberately EXCLUDED (their numbers are legitimately NOT the platform
totals — enforcing "current" here would corrupt real content):
  * Historical prose — changelogs, roadmaps, the blog, updates.html, the
    website-todo / flagship-specification working docs.
  * Per-item / contextual pages — course pages (courses/, 101-courses/),
    the practice tools (premium-tools/), book summaries, the Labs index,
    supabase e-mail templates.
  * Dynamic dashboards — org-dashboard.html (per-organisation learning-path
    sizes) and game-library.html (a "0 of 0 games" JS placeholder).
  * Translated docs (docs/bn|hi|mr|ta/…) — kept in sync manually.
  A line can also opt out inline with the token "count-ignore", and any
  line containing an arrow (→ / ->) is treated as historical prose.

The GitHub Wiki is a separate repository, so it is covered by the same
guard through --wiki: point it at a wiki clone and it scans that clone's
*.md the same way, minus Changelog.md and Roadmap.md (mirrors of the
repo's historical prose, excluded here for the same reason they are
excluded above). Before this existed, .github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml
refreshed exactly two hardcoded phrases on three of the eleven wiki
pages, so every other count on the wiki drifted silently: on 2026-08-19
the Book-Summaries and Premium pages were still claiming 163 reading
companions, 34 labs, 22 deep dives and 89 handouts.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check-counts.py           # report drift, exit 1 if any
  python3 scripts/check-counts.py --fix     # rewrite drift to canonical
  python3 scripts/check-counts.py --wiki DIR [--fix]   # scan a wiki clone

Workflow when adding content:
  1. Update the number in data/counts.json
  2. Run with --fix (or fix by hand from the report)
  3. Re-run until PASS

Exit 0 + "PASS" when clean; exit 1 with a drift listing otherwise.
