"""Measure every flagship against docs/flagship-course-standard.md, Part C.

Why this exists
---------------
The standard is written down; conformance to it was not measured. Part D of the
standard is a hand-made gap snapshot from 2026-07 covering two courses, and it
went stale immediately. Building the ESG flagship in 2026-08 surfaced the cost:
`social-movements`' shell carries no CSS for `stats-grid`, `key-insight` or any
callout colour, so content written to the standard renders unstyled there --
and nothing reported that.

This script reads the live `course_content` rows (content is not in the repo)
and each course shell, and prints one row per flagship. It takes the module
bodies on stdin as JSON so it can run without database credentials:

    python3 scripts/audit-flagships.py < modules.json

where modules.json is [{"course_id":..,"module_number":..,"content_html":..}, ..].
Pass --shell-only to skip the content half and audit just the shells.
