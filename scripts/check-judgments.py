"""Fail when a judgment entry makes a claim a reader cannot check.

Why this exists
---------------
A database of court judgments read by NGO staff will be used as legal
guidance whatever the disclaimer says. That makes two failure modes far
more expensive here than elsewhere on the platform.

The first is an unsourced holding. A case summary is exactly the kind of
content a language model produces fluently and wrongly, and a wrong
holding is indistinguishable from a right one at a glance. So every entry
must carry a link to the judgment text, and every entry must record that
someone checked the case name and year against that text -- `verified`
carries the date and the source it was checked against.

The second is a holding that was true and no longer is. Unni Krishnan was
substantially reworked by T.M.A. Pai. Section 66A was struck down in
Shreya Singhal and is still used to book people. Sabarimala sits before a
nine-judge bench. An entry that omits this reads authoritative and is
worse than no entry at all, so `status` is mandatory and constrained to a
vocabulary -- there is no "unknown" value, because "we did not check" is
not a thing this file may say silently.

Everything else here is ordinary referential integrity: statute tags must
name a law guide that exists, ids must be unique, no dangling cross-refs.
