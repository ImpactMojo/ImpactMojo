"""Every page in sitemap.xml must be findable in site search.

The sitemap is what we tell Google exists. `data/search-index.json` is what our
own visitors can find. They had drifted 127 pages apart -- 47 course posters, 19
reading companions, 17 course lexicons and 8 premium tools were live, crawlable
and advertised, and site search could not return any of them. Nothing failed:
adding a page updates the sitemap, and the index is a separate file nobody is
forced to touch.

Comparison is on the decoded, case-folded, fragment-stripped path, because the
index stores `%20` in handout paths and the sitemap does not -- comparing raw
strings reports 87 phantom gaps.

EXEMPT lists the pages deliberately left out, each with the reason. Adding to it
is a decision someone has to write down, which is the point.

It also asserts that `id` is unique across the index. That is here because
coverage is compared by url, so id collisions were invisible to every guard we
had: three ids were each carrying two different pages (#1031).
The cause is worth knowing, because it will recur otherwise -- the next id gets
chosen by reading the id of the *last* blog entry in the array, but the array is
not sorted by id, so the last blog entry was BLOG037 while the highest in the
file was BLOG061. Search still worked throughout, which is exactly why nobody
noticed.
