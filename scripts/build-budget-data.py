"""Extract data/union-budget.json from the vendored Budget at a Glance workbook.

Why the source is vendored
--------------------------
`indiabudget.gov.in` publishes Budget at a Glance as a 28 KB XLSX alongside the
PDF. Committing that file (data/sources/) rather than fetching it at build time
means this extraction is reproducible in CI with no network, and means the exact
bytes the numbers came from are in the repo history. When next year's budget is
published, drop in the new workbook and re-run.

Why the numbers are not hand-typed
----------------------------------
Every figure on the explorer is a Union government number that a reader may act
on. Transcribing 60-odd values by hand is the kind of task that produces one
wrong digit nobody ever finds, so the page reads a generated file and `--check`
fails when that file drifts from the workbook. Same contract as
build-law-guide-cases.py.

What this does NOT establish
----------------------------
That the figures are correct. The Ministry's own disclaimer says the Excel "has
been generated from System. In case of any inconsistency, pdf files will be
treated as final." So this pipeline is faithful to the XLSX, and the XLSX is not
the authority. The explorer says so, and so does `meta.authoritative`.
