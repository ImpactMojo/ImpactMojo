# Content Management

When adding or modifying content:

1. **Backup first**: `cp index.html Backups/index-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).html`
2. **Update content counts** in ALL locations — grep to find them:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "16 Games\|16 games" index.html catalog.html docs/
   ```
3. **Add to search index** (`data/search-index.json`):
   ```json
   {"id": "GAME017", "title": "...", "description": "...", "type": "game", "category": "...", "url": "/Games/...", "tags": [...]}
   ```
4. **Update docs**: `docs/games-guide.md`, `docs/labs-guide.md`, `docs/content-guide.md` as relevant
5. **Update changelog**: `docs/changelog.md` for user-facing changes
   - **5a. Learner-facing additions** (new games, labs, courses, book summaries, deep dives, blog posts, premium tools): also add a `- **Title** — short description` bullet to a `### For Learners` subsection in the release entry. The monthly newsletter (`netlify/functions/monthly-newsletter.mjs`) parses **only** that subsection — anything in `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` or topic-specific sections is treated as internal/dev-facing and ignored. Keep bullets short and benefit-focused; never include infra terms (Formspree, drip, RLS, Edge Function, migration, cron, webhook, etc.) — a defensive blocklist will strip them anyway.
6. **Update sitemap**: add `<url>` entry to `sitemap.xml`
7. **Update catalog**: `catalog.html` / `catalog_data.json` for courses
8. **Check stale links**: `grep -rn "101.impactmojo.in" index.html courses/` for refs that should be self-hosted
9. **Validate forms**: all forms use Netlify Forms (`data-netlify="true"` with `netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` and unique `name` attribute)
10. **GitHub Wiki**: clone `ImpactMojo/ImpactMojo.wiki.git`, update affected pages (Content-Guide, Changelog, type-specific pages), push
11. **GitHub Discussion**: create Announcements post for significant new content (games, courses, book summaries)
12. **GitHub Issues**: close related tracking issues with commit/PR links
